            <p>
                Rockying is branch-out of <a href="http://www.rudrasofttech.com/" target="_blank">RudraSofttech LLP</a>, 
                a software corporation based in Delhi
                that was launched in 2009. We are fresh and we are promising! Over a short span,
                Rudra Softtech has been engaged in providing a wide array of innovative technology
                solutions and services to a broad base of consumers — Rockying being our newest
                idea.
            </p>

                You would come across all kinds of content here — travel, Bollywood Masalas, some
                serious study on Hollywood cinema, food, internet, health, Fashion tips, etc (We
                are on an expansion spree, so do not be surprised to see new stuff coming up from
                our team of experienced bloggers and writers!)

                Our section Initiative is a perfect nom de plume for Rockying! This segment throws

                an initiative towards a better society,

            <h2>Our Inspiration...</h2>
            <p>
                To begin with Rockying is extremely choosy about filtering information. We do not
                simply hunt for content, the content finds us! At Rockying, we are extremely fussy
                about what we present to our reader. We do not simply throw information; our motto
                is to find stories that are interesting, add value to life and increase our knowledge
                base. We think differently, in a way that inspires our readers to learn more, do
                more and create more.
            </p>
            <h3>So what keeps us going? Rocky himself!</h3>

                We have named the website after our little brown-eyed pup. We are here to do what
                he does best — discover fun even in the drabbest of situations! Curiosity, thirst
                for fun and a hunger to explore are a few qualities that we share with Rocky.
            </p>
