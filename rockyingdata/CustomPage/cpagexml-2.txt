            &lt;h3&gt;
                2. Use License
            &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;ol type="a"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information
                    or software) on Rockying's web site for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing
                    only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license
                    you may not:
                    &lt;ol type="i"&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;modify or copy the materials;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial
                            or non-commercial);&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Rockying's web
                            site;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other
                            server.&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ol&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions
                    and may be terminated by Rockying at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of
                    these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded
                    materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format. &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                3. Disclaimer
            &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;ol type="a"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The materials on Rockying's web site are provided "as is". Rockying makes no warranties,
                    expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including
                    without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness
                    for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other
                    violation of rights. Further, Rockying does not warrant or make any representations
                    concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials
                    on its Internet web site or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites
                    linked to this site. &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                4. Limitations
            &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                In no event shall Rockying or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including,
                without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,)
                arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Rockying's Internet
                site, even if Rockying or a Rockying authorized representative has been notified
                orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions
                do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for
                consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                5. Revisions and Errata

                or photographic errors. Rockying does not warrant that any of the materials on its
                web site are accurate, complete, or current. Rockying may make changes to the materials
                contained on its web site at any time without notice. Rockying does not, however,
                make any commitment to update the materials.

                7. Site Terms of Use Modifications
