  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;ll of us watch movies for different reasons&amp;nbsp; - for the romance in it,
        the entertainment, for the sheer drama or just to beat the blues. We at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;
            Rockying&lt;/a&gt; love movies and recommending the best of every kind is almost our
        mission now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Going with the flow of just that spirit, we thought of bringing to the forefront
        some movies that make you end on a happy note. Most movies do actually, but here
        are some that focus on the power of hope and happiness both rolled into one. Often
        in life, we focus so much on the bigger picture that we miss out on smaller more significant
        things. And then, comes along a movie that makes us realize that life is definitely
        beautiful and there is so much to take from it. &lt;b&gt;Here are some hand-picked movies
            that not only make you smile but fill you with hope for a better tomorrow:&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Hope/Tuscany.jpg" title="Under The Tuscan Sun" alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Having just been through a divorce, a writer buys a villa in Tuscany in hopes that
                it will be the first step to bring about the changes in life that she has always
                hoped for.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Based on Frances Mayes’ memoir of the same name; it highlights a woman struggle
                in building a new home, a new life, and in finding love.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                But most importantly it brings to notice the fact that she restores her life all
                through it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                THE BUCKET LIST&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Hope/the-bucket-list.jpg" title="The Bucket List" alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it
                begins with the story of two terminally ill patients meeting at the hospital room;
                it goes on to have them lead their remaining lives just as they would have wanted
                to all the way along.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                Brilliant performances by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman is just like the icing
                on the cake. The movie ends with the obvious; but with both the actors living their
                remaining life to the fullest; enjoying it all along.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                EAT, PRAY, LOVE&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Hope/Eat-Pray%20-Love.jpg" title="Eat Pray Love" alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Elizabeth
                Gilbert’s memoir of the same name; it highlights her story of self discovery. Post
                divorce, Elizabeth goes on a journey to three different countries and accounts her
                experiences that made the better, far more nurtured and a wonderful human inside
                out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She indulges in good food in Italy, gets in touch with her spiritual side in India
                and then to bring it all to a full circle goes to Indonesia where she eventually
                finds love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wonderful rendition of triumph over all that life offers.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS&lt;/h3&gt;

                how struggle turns into transforming Chris into one of the biggest stock brokers
                and entrepreneur of recent times.
