Ekta Kapoor is currently basking in the success of her latest flick the Dirty picture which got raving reviews from cinema lovers.<br>&nbsp;However, the 36 year old finds it difficult to keep herself away from the small screen and at a launch of her latest serial ‘Kya hua Tera Vaada’ she had no qualms in giving her due to television and that no matter what she does she will always come back to her homeground, her daily soaps.<br>&nbsp;Ekta’s works like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi and Kahaani ghar ghar ki, popularly known as the saas-bahu serials received huge acclaim and made her into the Queen of Prime time shows.<br>The Icon, coming from a star studded family of father Jitendra and brother Tusshar Kapoor could have easily got into acting but instead opted to make her own mark through the idiot box. <br>The Producer, also has hits like Shoot out at Lokhandwala and Once Upon a time in Mumbaai to her credit.<br>The stylish lass may have made it huge on both screens but still remains grounded and accredits her art of storytelling to her knowledge from the small screen. She says “Coming back to work on television from films is like coming back home from a long vacation”.<br>2011 turned out a mixed bag for Ekta. Brother Tusshar’s performance in Shor in the City gathered applause but not good enough for the film to work at the Box office. <br>Next came Ragini MMS guaranteeing to be the scariest movie ever but came and went without grabbing much attention.<br>Ekta’s lady luck had something else in store for her coz then had to come ... The Dirty picture. Excellent direction by Milan Luthria, and superb acting performance by Vidya Balan helped Ekta Kapoor proved her metal once again.<br>So now, let us all get set for her much awaited sequel of “Once Upon a Time in mumbaai” where Akshay the Khiladi Boy plays the lead. Way to go Lady. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></p>
