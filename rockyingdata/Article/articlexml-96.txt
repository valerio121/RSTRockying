  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    Bollywood completes its 100th year this 2013, Rockying has a reason to celebrate
    and give you a different tadka of Bollywood starting today- thoda hatke! After the
    &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/60"&gt;evergreen classic series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/87"&gt;
        Bollywood and Sportology&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/35"&gt;pathbreaking
            dialogues of Indian cinema&lt;/a&gt;, we present to you the portrayal of professions
    dealt the celluloid way. You got the passion for profession? Read on...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/MeraNaamJoker.jpg"
        title="Raj Kapoor in Mera Naam Joker" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;MERA NAAM JOKER (1970)&lt;/strong&gt;: We rate this as a lucid and passionate professional
    representation. A child just wanting to be like his father- a clown, Mera Naam Joker
    is existential and humanistic both. The profession is so simple: to make others
    laugh. This film makes us retrospect in every way possible about being in love with
    the profession we choose. "&lt;i&gt;Jeena yahan, marna yahan, iske siva jana kahan&lt;/i&gt;
    .." Raj Kapoor’s death in this film too is tragic as he dies during his last performance.
    One may watch this film for variety of reasons but Rockying says this is the tonic
    water for a true professional enthusiast!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/Disco_Dancer.jpg"
        title="Mithun in Disco Dancer" alt="" style="max-height: 250px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCO
            DANCER (1982)&lt;/strong&gt;: Who does not remember Mithun’s Indian style pelvic thrust?
    Anil aka Mithun Chakravarty is noticeably passionate about dancing in the movie
    and is a street performer who gets to realize his dream in a fierce International
    Disco Dancing competition. As Anil transforms into Jimmy, some nasty revenge awaits
    him on stage during his performance. Jimmy’s electric guitar is connected to 5ooo
    volts of electricity causing his mother’s untimely tragic death. A true dancing
    saga of the 1980s, with this film the audience still frowns to see Mithun dance
    his last steps to regain his position back in the competition. Dance is a movement
    that comes from the heart and that’s why Rockying calls him the Joshua Berger of
    Bollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/Lakshya.jpg"
        title="Hrithik Roshan in Lakshya" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;LAKSHYA (2004)&lt;/strong&gt;: Passion lost and found, this Hrithik Roshan starrer film
    voices its dilemma of hundreds of teenagers who grapple to find focus in life.&amp;nbsp;
    No plans, no goals, Karan is not keen on joining his father’s business and also
    drops out of the army. The turning point comes when his girl friend, our bubbly
    Priety Zinta ditches him seeing his aimlessness and the lack of zeal to make it
    big in life. He joins army back, undergoes severe punishment and gains several medals
    post the Kargil war, then on. In other words, it takes him a girl to realize his
    lakshya. But nevertheless, this movie has something that every youth can relate
    to. Hence, this goes into our list of favorites as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/Rock_on.jpg"
        title="Arjun Rampal, Farhan Akhtar and Luke Kenny in Rock On" alt="" style="max-height: 235px;"
        class="pull-left" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;ROCK ON (2008)&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Farhan Akhtar’s raw voice that he shares with three
    other men in the film to form a rock band Magik, disintegrates with the changing
    phase of his life. He turns to the corporate world while the rest too find things
    other than some desi-style head banging. Somehow, even steady money inflow does
    not bring that spark back in Farhan’s life and as the movie delves deep, the camera
    shows both Farhan and the audience as to what is missing. His blind search for money
    and fame makes him search for his spirit in the lost and found section of life.
    What is the moral of the story? Do what the heart wants. Passion+profession= Some
    assured Rock On!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/Fashion_.jpg"
        title="Kangana Ranaut and Priyanka Chopra in Fashion" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;"
        class="pull-left" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FASHION (2008)&lt;/strong&gt;: Priyanka Chopra’s fanaticism to walk
    the ramp and her prowess for modeling parallels Kangana Ranaut’s success in the
    film. One’s downfall leads to the rise of the other. This phoenix-like image is
    the perfect symbolic meaning of the true calling of the heart. Not to fall into
    the perils of what any industry would offer today, is the lesson we learn. For Rockying
    this is about being at the bottom of the fashion food chain, go through hell and
    bring back to life. We all go through this, don’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/bollywood/Professions-Bollywood/Aarakshan2.jpg"
        title="Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Tanvi Azmi in Aarakshan"
        alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AARAKSHAN (2011)&lt;/strong&gt;:
    Saif Ali Khan and Amitabh Bachchan fight it out for the education industry at large
    as they find their own foothold within the industry a bit shaken because of the
    rising quota system. Extremely sensitive to the Indian sentimentality, this film
    administers the case of people who have no idea about the changing law structure
    and struggle to keep their passion as teachers untainted with several other money-minting
    educational institutions. As the movie’s tag line goes “India vs India” we also
    call it a conscious reality check for individuals and teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="rstquestion"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FUN QUIZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;
           Whose downfall lead to the rise of Priyanka Chopra’s character in Madhur Bhandarkar’s &lt;i&gt;Fashion&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li data-anwser="correct"&gt;Kangna Ranaut&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Mugdha Godse&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Kitu Gidwani&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Suchitra Pillai&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    There are no rules when it comes to making your profession and following it passionately.
    Way to go Bollywood! Here on, begins the virtual Bollywood celebration. Watch out
    for this space for more!&lt;/h5&gt;</Text>
