I also enjoyed the activities in Kaziranga National park riding on Elephant Safari &amp;amp;amp; jeep

And after having lots of fun in Parks, the tour guide took us to the religious temple called as
Kamakhya temple the temple was beautifully furnished and was dedicated to Goddess
Kamakhya and is one of the prominent Shaktipeeth of the country.
Also I visit the other places of Assam like Majuli Island (the biggest Island in world),
Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Guwahati (the main city for entire North East India).
These places were absolutely gorgeous and I think I found my new dream home.
After completing my First Tour in Assam my tour guide takes me to the most magical,
fascinating and scenically spectacular, a mountain journey to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh
which was my second trip.

Tawang Monastery
One of the Northeast’s greatest attractions .
After spending a time in Tawang Monastery next day we drive through the eastern
Himalayas to Dirang. After breakfast, we visit Old Dirang, its winding streams and Old Fort.
And also we take a light trek through Sangti Valley and enjoy fantastic views of Dirang.

Dirang

This was also an awesome place which is renowned for its ideal hill resort in West Kameng
district with beautiful Apple Nursery, Kiwi Farm, Yak Research Centre and more.
The trip covered the Western Arunachal Pradesh which is having highest motorable pass of
4,050 meter MSL.
The Largest Buddhist Monasteries outside Tibet, the Gompas, the Monpa tribe, Snow
capped Himalayan Mountain range had made Arunachal Pradesh more interesting and
wonderful. Arunachal Pradesh is also best for the one those who love to do trekking.
And my next target was to visit Meghalaya which was called the “ABODE OF CLOUDS “.

Dowky River of (Meghalaya)
Visiting this place I feel like that I am in the lape of Nature, these places in incredible!! One
can stay here without any doubt.
I had only study that Meghalaya is one of the wettest place on Earth, amm since I was in
class five I studied this is general knowledge, but when I see in reality it was truly awesome.
What to explore in Meghalaya?
Mawlangbna Village in Mawsynram of East Khasi Hills is still maintaining its natural virginity
and less hitting of tourist.

Mawsynram Meghalaya
This wettest place on Earth gives some of the best attractions which is same or better than
Cherrapunji. Among them are Nature Trail and Fossil spotting in Mawlangbna, Village visit,
Natural rocky Water Reservoir, Split Rock, Lots of small and Big Falls, View of Bangladesh
plains etc.

Another view Mawllynnong Village, which is around 3 hours drive from Shillong is situated in
East Khasi Hills district and also referred as “God’s Own Garden”. The Village and its
neighbour area offers picturesque natural beauty, Living root bridge, Water Falls, Old
Church, Short and long Natural Trails .

Living Root ( Meghalaya)
Exploring the wettest place of North East we came forward to Nagaland.
So, what can you explore in Nagaland?
 Historical Monuments of Sivasagar

 Visiting of various Tribal villages in Nagaland

 Hornbill Festival

Nagaland known for a home of near about 16 tribes the state has much more to explore.
Tribe and clan traditions and loyalties play an important part in the life of Nagas.
Weaving is a traditional art handed down through generations in Nagaland.

Each of the tribe has its own unique designs and colors, producing shawl, shoulder bags,
decorative spears, table mats, wood carvings, and bamboo works. Also the History of
Assam and Wildlife experiences will be prime attractions.
It was great to be able to sit in one place for days and enjoy a bit of class. But it’s time for
me to put down roots and have a home. Instead of days of travelling around North East
India, the man without a home will finally have one to return to.
Not only the whole places I could travel in North East but also I had collected all the
movements as my good memories.
So, if you also want to spend your holiday far from your city then North East India will be a
best destination!
Hurry Up! Don’t just wait for time, pack your bags be confident and get ready to experience
your first tour.</Text>
