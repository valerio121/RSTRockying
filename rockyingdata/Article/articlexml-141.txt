    might be your wedding, a dance performance or simply an effort to look slimmer than
    your peers that initiates you towards weight loss. We say reflect twice before adopting
    a dietary pattern that might be the current fad of the season. You might be sizing
    down faster than you imagined, but it might just be your ticket to heaven!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all diet pills and patterns are suitable for you. Therefore, following diet
        patterns can be a risky business. Just do not pick up any random bottle of pills
        that say “Weight Loss”. Even the branded ones available in the market might not
        be suitably licensed. You, therefore, might be losing weight evidently but can suffer
        from skin diseases, boils or hair loss!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please do not trust any drug in the
            market that says “Lose Weight the Natural Way”. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;
                Rockying&lt;/a&gt; says that the only way to shed kilos the natural way is to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                    If it is a doctor or your personal trainer who has prescribed you some drugs to
                    reduce weight, then put your thinking cap on. The doctors who guarantee 12 kilos
                    weight loss in one week are definitely doing some uncalled-for damage to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                        Several foreign brands such as Xiushentang, Rapid Weight Loss Diet Pills, Herbaslim
                        or drugs that need to be injected into the skin or inhaled through the nose should
                        be out rightly rejected. This is because they directly hit the stomach giving instant
                        results but damaging the body infinitely. These can cause heart attacks, strokes
                        and spasms. Some drugs cause such tricky side effects that it is hard to trace the
                        cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check for a component called phenolphthalein, clenbuterol, liberium
                            and sibutramine. These are banned by FDA, are lethal and can cause reactions that
                            can lead to unconsciousness or even death. Women, especially, experience a discoloration
                            of their skin in several places. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At the end of the day, know your body and its capacity. If at all you think you
    need some serious tone down, then set yourself a time period and exercise accordingly.
    Rome was not built in a day and when it comes to health, this better be a good reminder.
