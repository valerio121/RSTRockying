    finally realized that an argument with your boss on a regular basis is killing your
    appetite and increasing your nicotine intake. Take a minute to think why your boss
    always is at the pink of his health and boasts of a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, he
    delegates tension and he delegates his work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Read on to know more about a few things that would keep you healthy and away from
    stress while work:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Stop thinking post work&lt;/strong&gt;: You are like this ship of the desert and your boss
            thinks you can manage to survive without water and food for 28 days. The work files
            and data chips would be put on your two humps and you are supposed to wade through
            the workload. This is exactly where you need to stop! Work but drop it when you
            are back home. The best way to beat stress is to join a sports club and sweat it
            out. Table tennis, simple cardios or plain socializing can be the best way to gain
            your health back. Now scare your boss and you know how!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Stop measuring your life in coffee spoons&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; A mug of coffee can be your
            savior if you have been actually drooping over your keyboard post lunch. But you
            must know where to draw a line. The god of poetry Sir T S Eliot must have meant
            something when he said “Tired of measuring my life in coffee spoons”, eh? Coffee
            can make you look worn down if you are consuming too much. So here is what you need
            to do! Think herbal. Have green teas or organic tea the next time you are thinking
            of beating coffee at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rediscover a special relationship with your pillow&lt;/strong&gt;: Sleep. You can actually
            manage to reach office late, and still see that the earth did not fall apart. If
            you worked overtime the previous night, it is high time that you learn to take liberties
            at work. Let this be the mantra for those honest donkeys slaving at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Eat healthy&lt;/strong&gt;: Each time you find yourself stealing a bite of those samosas
            available near your workstation, stop yourself. Food provides you primary sustenance
            and you must pause to think what is going wring in your diet. Even if you are not
            a diet exert, try the basic. Replace fried stuff with fruits and you will feel the
            energy come back to you.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    After all, there is a reason why Japanese people live longer!
