  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    We all have our picks when it comes to the movies. Some like the animated wonders
    of Pixar while others prefer the superhero epics. It is the storytelling genres
    in Hollywood that has given us all our own personal favorites and here is a short
    recap of the evolution it has gone through over the years. See if you can find the
    roots of your favorite genre!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            The 30s &amp; the 40s&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/30s-40s-Collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 30s and 40s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Golden Age of Hollywood. Romance ruled the screens and gave us fine movies like
            &lt;strong&gt;Gone with the Wind &lt;/strong&gt;that have stood the test of time. The studios also flirted
            with every story telling genre there is and gave classics such as &lt;strong&gt;King Kong&lt;/strong&gt;
            (Adventure), Citizen Kane &amp; Hells Angels (Drama) &amp; &lt;strong&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/strong&gt; (fantasy).
            This was the time when Disney first created the animation genre with classics like
            &lt;strong&gt;Bambi, Fantasia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Snow White &amp; the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/strong&gt;. With a wide variety
            of movies being made in every possible storytelling genres, Hollywood was at its
            best in its first years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            The 50s &amp; 60s&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/50s-60s-collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 50s and 60s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The studios had become totally bound by a formula (much like Bollywood in the 90s)and
            the audience soon got bored with the same old heroic romances. It rejected big budget
            flicks featuring stars like Elizabeth taylor in &lt;strong&gt;Cleopatra &lt;/strong&gt;and only a lucky
            few survived these dull days which included Charlton Heston’s chariot driving antics
            in the epic &lt;strong&gt;Ben-Hur &lt;/strong&gt;and the joyful Julie Andrews singing in the Swiss Alps
            in &lt;strong&gt;Sound of Music&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul Newman-Robert Redford starrer &lt;strong&gt;Butch Cassidy &lt;/strong&gt;
            and the Sundance Kid gave the “Western” genre a breath of fresh air, visionary director
            Stanley Kubrick revitalised science fiction through a cult classic &lt;strong&gt;2001: A Space
                Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            The 70s&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/70s-collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 70s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The cinema storyteller’s dream decade changed it all. A new wave of maverick directors
            like George Lucas and the now famous Steven Spielberg burst upon the scene and created
            the genre of Hollywood Blockbuster making movies like &lt;strong&gt;Star Wars &amp; Jaws&lt;/strong&gt;. The
            absolute masala entertainers - epic yet simple stories filled to the brim with big
            special effects &amp;, bigger stars. Also born in this whacky decade was a second genre
            of Realistic cinema which gave us complex classics such as &lt;strong&gt;The Godfather (Crime),
                Taxi Driver (Drama) and Rocky (Sports/Drama)&lt;/strong&gt;. The cult of horror was also
            revitalised with &lt;strong&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/strong&gt; smashing box office records the world over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            The 80s&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/80s-collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 80s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The blockbusters were here to stay and the Star Wars franchise ruled the box office
            in the 80s. The studios were quick to cash in the success mantra and many more fantasy/sci-fi/adventure
            movies like the &lt;strong&gt;Indiana Jones &lt;/strong&gt;movies, the &lt;strong&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/strong&gt; series,
            &lt;strong&gt;Batman &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Ghostbusters &lt;/strong&gt;were presented to packed cinema halls. Hollywood
            had discovered its “formula” ( like we did with DDLJ!) The decade was the time of
            big hits but little adventure in storytelling methods and only a handful of directors
            pleased the intelligent viewer with classics like &lt;strong&gt;Gandhi &lt;/strong&gt;(Historical Drama)
            and the cult hit &lt;strong&gt;E.T &lt;/strong&gt;(the sci-fi classic which inspired our own Koi Mil Gaya).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            The 90s&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/90s-collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 90s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Computer Graphics were born. CGI or Computer Generated Imagery revolutionized the
            industry by gifting hits such as &lt;strong&gt;Jurassic Park, Independence Day and Men in Black
            &lt;/strong&gt;where technology empowered the storytellers to create a believable fantasy world.
            The makers could depict almost anything on the screens now, their imagination being
            their only boundary. Two major genres from the Golden Age were revived in a big
            way in this decade. Disney and Pixar recreated the magic of animation movies with
            &lt;strong&gt;Toy Story&lt;/strong&gt; while the romance genre was brought back to life by &lt;strong&gt;Titanic
            &lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            2000 On...&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Story-telling-Evolution/2000s-collage.jpg"
            alt="Hollywood Movies in 2000s" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The reign of the special effect blockbuster continued in Hollywood. &lt;strong&gt;The Harry Potter
                series, Avatar, Lord of the Rings, Transformers and the Spider Man &lt;/strong&gt;movies
            reinforced the studio’s faith in epic storytelling and lavish CGI effects. But the
            decade also saw many gritty and realistic movies being made. &lt;strong&gt;Passion of the Christ,
                Memento &amp; Inception &lt;/strong&gt;are shining examples of movies which respect their audience’s
            intellect. Even the big studios took notice and the success of two “different” blockbusters-
            &lt;strong&gt;The Matrix &amp; The Dark Knight &lt;/strong&gt;created a new storytelling method – the realistic
            fantasy. Independent movies like &lt;strong&gt;Paranormal Activity, Pan’s Labyrinth and Little
                Miss Sunshine &lt;/strong&gt;also created the strong “indie” genre of movie making and
            its fans have only grown ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It took almost a hundred years for the story telling genres in Hollywood to reach
    the status it enjoys today and there was similar evolution across the colourful
    spectrum of Hollywood. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag?ref=hl" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; Keeping her eyes closed, with long breaths and a gentle sound many mistake for snoring, actually helps Sonali think better. Or so she says. People question about these daily “thinking sessions”, mostly conducted on a comfortable couch or bed, while she claims that the long overdue best-seller she’s been working on (for quite some time now) will silence all the cynics. Till then she dreams on...
