  <Text>&lt;H4&gt;Comedy, No Laughing Matter!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Comedy is serious business. In fact, it is no child’s play for film makers to tickle
    the funny bone of a multitude and yet laugh all the way to the bank. Bollywood history
    is replete with comic capers that have left an indelible impression for the sheer
    command exhibited in this genre. Real comedy is not banana peel or double entendre
    type. Humor is that sparkling wit that makes its point sans being gross or hurting
    viewer sensibilities. Here's my list of flicks that have it ingested in them. Read on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Half Ticket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Half-Ticket.jpg" alt="Half Ticket"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kishore Kumar was actor -filmmaker with his pulse on this form of entertainment.
            His screen-presence was enough to light up the screen and if proceedings peaked,
            then time to roll in the aisles. Half Ticket was comedy cinema par excellence and
            even those of us not from that time, can retrace steps to the Black and White era
            when faces and mannerisms conveyed a lot, encompassing each viewer on a amusing
            rollercoaster ride with that singularly catchy sensation in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Chalti Ka Naam Gadi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/chalti-ka-naam-gaadi.jpg" alt="Chalti ka Naam Gadi"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chalti Ka Naam Gadi was an enjoyable long-drive in the company of the funniest trio
            of the Kumar Brothers. Not a moment went by when audience faces did not sport a
            laugh or at least a genuine smirk watching this frisky frolic.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Padosan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Padosan.jpg" alt="Padosan"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Similarly, Padosan is another personal choice for the absolute madness that went
            in the name of comedy. Here is a bunch of dim-wit characters that ran the show and
            what a show it was! Director Jyoti Swaroop proved his intelligence in this humor-infused
            saga that even today is flagship for Bollywood comedies that would live on even
            after each viewer has seen it second-time round!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Bombay To Goa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Bombay-To-Goa..jpg" alt="Bombay to Goa"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bombay To Goa another colossal has immense rerun value for its rib-tickling moments
            and seems as funny when watched for the nth time as when first viewed. A gawky Bachchan
            (not particularly at the helm of proceedings) proves his mark where a cauldron of
            funny characters is etched against the backdrop of a bus trip. Here was a film that
            had a certain joie de vivre never mind if there was no story to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Chupke Chupke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/chupke-chupke.jpg" alt="Chupke Chupke"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Veteran craftsman Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s 1975 film Chupke Chupke is a work of art,
            landmark; given the absolute sincerity with which a simple tale has been executed
            with master dexterity. Who can forget the dialogues exchanged in chaste Hindi between
            Om Prakash and Dharmendra which when seen even today guarantee a gudd-guddi in my
            insides. Chances are each of you has seen it already, else, please do not miss this
            gem and I bet you will giggle like a bunch of giddy-headed schoolgirls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Golmaal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Golmaal.jpg" alt="Golmaal"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Another masterpiece under the baton of Hrishi da, is Golmaal (1979) the finest predecessor
            to the Rohit Shetty string of the Golmaal series. The annals of Bollywood comedy
            films cannot be written without mention of this classic which held its own in an
            era when action was king and the ‘angry young man’ phenomenon had the country in
            it’s firm grip. Here came a film, poised and composed, introducing the nation to
            a variety that was refreshingly engaging. Its impact was such that till date it
            is one of its kind and inspiration to several film-makers in the years that followed.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Angoor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Angoor.jpg" alt="Angoor"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            My personal favorite, which I consider finest among the best, is definitely Gulzar’s
            1982 magnum opus Angoor. This laughathon based on Shakespeare’s ‘A Comedy of Errors’
            did not have a single dull split second-- a million brilliant cascading moments
            each interwoven beautifully to produce a hilarious tapestry! It has the distinctive
            quality of Dresden China among several other comedy biggies which simply pale into
            comparison. The finesse of script, dialogues, and performances made this one a top-notch
            cine goers’ glee!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Chashme Buddoor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/chashme-buddoor.jpg" alt="Chashme-buddoor"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            An excellent story-teller though much-underrated, Sai Paranjpe made a few ‘hat ke’
            films among them one with five-star comic relief rating Chashme Buddoor in 1981.
            Shorn off a star-cast, this film scored on sheer ingenuity and simplicity with which
            the story unfolded. Such a film belongs to the once-in-a-while category and certainly
            deserves a golden mention here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Andaz Apna Apna&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/andaz_apna_apna.jpg" alt="Andaz apna apna"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            ‘Ghayal’ director Raj Kumar Santoshi known for his action films tackled something
            not done earlier with Andaz Apna Apna in 1994 and what a diversion it proved on
            his highway that had never sported a ‘comic stop’. The calling card of this lilting
            light-headed breezy film was excellent screen presence of the two Khans—Aamir and
            Salman being in their comic elements. Even today, I would rate it as a masterpiece
            deserving earnest applause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Hera Pheri&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/Hera-Pheri.jpg" alt="Hera Pheri"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ace director Priyadarshan has to his credit the inimitable Hera Pheri which adequately
            brought out the comic timing of Khiladi Kumar, Akshay. It even made non-actor Suniel
            Shetty emote with a degree of intensity not to speak of the doyen of several comedies
            Paresh ‘Peerless’ Rawal. Another film from the same director Hungama also deserves
            mention here for its laugh-a-minute eminence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            3 Idiots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Bollywood-Comedies-Contest-Entry-1/3-idiots.jpg" alt="3 Idiots"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Recently, Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots has surpassed all records, emerging as one
            come to stay as benchmark of quality comedy. Several loopholes in the education
            system were dealt with a tinge, nay loads of hilarity. One almost overlooked the
            fact that Aamir Khan was essaying the role of a college student busy as we were
            concentrating on each nuance of the finest of fine in every department, be it acting,
            music, cinematography, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There are scores of films worth mentioning like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Khosla ka Ghosla, Chachi 420, Hungama, Do Phool, Munnabhai MBBS, Chup Chup
    Ke, Bheja Fry and even the Golmaal series to some extent but they come lower
    on the rating ladder though my choice is subjective and open to discussion. Seems
    I’ve been bitten by the comic bug and yes, I am! In fact, I could just go on and
    on because this is one genre that helps a viewer unwind at nominal cost of a film
    ticket. It also reflects creativity and resourcefulness of a film-maker who designs
    a successful comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here’s a toast to these tour de force films! May we have more directors willing
    to explore newer avenues to keep the banner of comedy flying high! Hail Comedy!
&lt;/p&gt;
