    An essential part of movie making and one of the most powerful visual tools in the
    hand of the makers is the subtle and often underrated art of make-up. From simple
    beginnings it has evolved into a modern day hybrid of prosthetics and graphics.
    After &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/225" target=_blank"&gt;the magical ride of Hollywood special effects &lt;/a&gt;Rockying brings to you a rare focus on the evolution of the art of movie make-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    THE EARLY ERA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Make-up-Evolution/Karloff-and-Pierce-The-Mummy-MMW.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;
    Hollywood started its relation with the art of make-up in the same vein as theatre.
    The aim was very simple: to make the actors look as presentable as possible. The
    make-up artists struggled mainly with mascara, lipsticks and blushes to transform
    the actresses (and even some dandy actors!) into magical beauties. Early stars such
    as Greta Garbo owed a lot to early make-up greats like George Westmore, who worked
    on almost 2/3rds of all movies produced during the silent era! Also significant
    were the early horror classics such as THE MUMMY where make-up turned actor Boris
    Karloff into a monster with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
    BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p  style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Audrey Hepburn getting her make up on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The rise of Divas saw the birth of thefusion between high fashion and Hollywood.
    Legendary beauties like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe owed much to the hard
    working make-up artists who worked behind the scenes to give them looks that would
    inspire a generation. Also, Hollywood hairstyle and make up tips inspired millions
    of ordinary women across the globe and even today remains the source from which
    most copy their styles. Be it Jennifer Aniston’s hairdo in FRIENDS or the carefully
    puffed up hair-do of Elvis Presley during his heydays, Hollywood became the altar
    at which fashion fans worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
    CHARACTER CREATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p  style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Creating lifelike apes in PLANET OF THE APES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Hollywood make up moved from being an extension of popular fashion to a powerful
    tool of character creation in the early 70s.From beautification alone, the focus
    was now on creation of characters who relied on advanced prosthetics in order to
    look believable to the audiences. THE PLANET OF THE APES (1968) was one of the early
    pioneers giving us talking apes that look real even by today’s standards. The sudden
    spurt of sci-fi movies post STAR WARS also gave the make- up artists an opportunity
    to go insanely creative. However, it was not all fancy face paint and outlandish
    hairdos. Winners of the Oscar for best make up included movies like GANDHI, where
    Ben Kingsley and Roshan Seth gave us images of the Mahatma and Pandit Nehru that
    will live on in our memory forever. Later winners included Robin Williams’ cross
    dressing act in MRS DOUBTFIRE (that ‘inspired’ Kamal Hassan’s CHACHI 420) and even
    the subtle, period make up in TITANIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Computers changed everything in Hollywood, including make-up. Modern motion capture
    tech includes a procedure that involves placing tiny sensors on dozens of muscles
    on an actor’s face. These sensors pick up every muscle movement as the actors acts
    in front of the camera. Later, the acting is retained even as the data from the
    sensors is used to give the same actor a whole new face, a wonderful effect that
    would be impossible without CGI. The dramatic face sported by Bill Nighy as Davy
    Jones in the PIRATES OF CARRIBEAN franchise and the amazing prosthetic and CGI combo
    on Brad Pitt in CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON are sterling examples of this bold
    new step in Hollywood make up history.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h6&gt;Nothing is beyond possibility on the silver screen and the movie maker’s imagination
    is now the only boundary!&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; Keeping her eyes closed, with long breaths and a gentle sound many mistake for snoring, actually helps &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sonali&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; think better. Or so she says. People question about these daily “thinking sessions”, mostly conducted on a comfortable couch or bed, while she claims that the long overdue best-seller she’s been working on (for quite some time now) will silence all the cynics. Till then she dreams on...
