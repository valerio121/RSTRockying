    &lt;b&gt;Bhooli Bisri Sunehri Yaadein...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    When it comes to understanding Bollywood classics, it is about sheer cinematic brilliance,
    path breaking dialogues, black and white settings, an angry dad smoking a pipe,
    too much of glycerin outpour and stagnant melodrama. Let us understand the Age.
    We had not yet seen Madhuri’s dhak dhak, and Karishma’s jalwa. Cinema was developing
    and Raj Kapoor was the only star we knew of besides Saira Banu, Dev Anand, Mumtaz
    and Ashok Kumar. Let us retrace some timeless sagas of Bollywood at a glance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/Kismet.jpg" title="Kismet 1943"
                alt="" style="max-height: 140px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/220px-Kismet1943film.jpg" title="Kismet 1943"
                alt="" style="max-height: 210px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bombay Talkies’ Kismet
            &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;1943&lt;/i&gt;) was a &lt;b&gt;Gyan Mukherjee&lt;/b&gt; directed film that was construed as
            a thematically bold film and brought out our sadda villain in fashion. Indian films
            made before this film generated sympathy, but Kismet evoked apathy in the Indian
            audience- a feeling that we were not acquainted with. This cinema shook the audience
            with its first unmarried woman character who was shown pregnant. If you are actually
            hungry for more, hear this out. This was also the first film ever made that incorporated
            the possibility of a double role! Do you have any idea how much money did this film
            make way back in the 20th century? Close to 63 crores!!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Mehboob Khan’s Andaz&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/Andaz%20%281%29.jpg" title="Nargis and Raj Kapoor in Andaz"
                alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/Andaz.jpg" title="Dilip Kumar and Nargis In Andaz"
                alt="" style="max-width: 250px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;(&lt;i&gt;1949&lt;/i&gt;) stars &lt;b&gt;Raj Kapoor
                    and Dilip Kumar&lt;/b&gt;—the two eminent actors of Bollywood who came together
            for their only film ever. They formed the perfect love triangle ever with Nargis.
            The 20-year old &lt;b&gt;Nargis&lt;/b&gt; in this film inevitably reminds us of Audrey Hepburn
            in Roman Holiday. A delicately woven love story, the lady is rich and questions the age-old question – if at all a woman can
            stay friends male counterparts. The film drips with the nouveau rich depiction where
            Nargis is shown to go for horse riding in Jodhpur, this film portray men in total
            megalomaniac modes. If you want to feel totally wounded by cupid, here is a must-watch
            for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/Mahal.jpg" title="Madhubala In Mahal"
                alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            Remember, Ek Teer Chalaa Dil pe Lagaa? &lt;b&gt;Mahal (1949)&lt;/b&gt; made &lt;b&gt;Ashok Kumar &lt;/b&gt;
            and&lt;b&gt; Madhubala &lt;/b&gt;the hottest pair of the 20th century. The king of supernatural
            suspense that still sends down thrills down one’s spine, this is all about reincarnation.
            This film is supposedly said to have put world cinema into motion with this new
            concept. The Reincarnation of peter Proud is an influence of Mahal. This is what
            Bollywood is all about. It can surprise you in the most unimaginable ways!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/RajKapoorNargisAwara05.jpg"
                title="Raj Kapoor and Nargis in Awara" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
            We are talking about an immortal classic here, &lt;b&gt;Awara (1951&lt;/b&gt;). This film is
            a close cropped view on the black and white era when the Kapoor’s make Bollywood
            cinema worth an experience. The plot revolves around the classic good-wins-over-evil
            and the evil will never change its ways. Jagga who is convicted by the wealthy judge
            Raghunath goes on to kidnap the judge’s wife Leela for revenge rolling the movie
            into motion. Raj, her son also turns into a criminal due to unfortunate circumstances
            and turns to Jagga as his Guru. The former tries to quit the world of crime but
            fails umpteen number of times thereby making the story highly cathartic. Nominated
            for the Cannes way back in 1953 and remade into a Turkish film, this film has won
            many hearts in the entire Indian subcontinent and abroad in countries such as Africa,
            Middle East and Soviet Union!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Cults/Do_Bigha_Zameen.jpg" title="Nirupa Roy and Balraj Sahnii In Do Bigha Zameen"
                alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            You sure don't wish to get introduced to &lt;b&gt;Bimal Roy’s Do Bigha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Zameen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
                (1953)&lt;/b&gt;, gone beyond success and gave the cinema culture in India a new turn.
            It won the Cannes Award and also won the Filmfare award. Do you know where this
            film got its title from? Tagore’s poem – ‘Dui Bigha jomin’. After this, Indian cinema
            never remained the same. Aping Vittorio de Sica’s Bicycle Thieves, the plot is set
            in a drab village on the verge of famine. Shambhu (&lt;b&gt;Balraj Sahni&lt;/b&gt;), the central
            protagonist owns two bighas, as goes the title, on which a wealthy constructor wants
            to setup a mill to make profit. This land being the only livelihood of Shambhu,
            he refuses. Later he ends up losing the legal dispute as well. The movie comes to
            a climax when Shambhu returns to his village to see the construction has begun and
            they silently walk away from their do bigha zamin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
