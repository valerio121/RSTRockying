Climbing the Himalayas is one of those things you want to include on your bucket list for its incredible beauty and the feeling of smallness and awe you get when being surrounded by the highest mountain peaks on the planet. There are so many places you can visit for sightseeing, trekking or exploring the multitude of cultures around the great mountain chain.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

For trekking beginners or those who would prefer to do something else, there are plenty of cultural sites, museums, and religious structures to visit. You can study Yoga or Meditation or go try rafting in the untamed rivers of upper Himalaya.

In order to enjoy Himalaya to the fullest, you must go trekking and see for yourself the amazing landscapes.
