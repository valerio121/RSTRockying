    is something about this summer. After strong winter chills, the first few months
    are always gleeful and we do not usually mind the sun. So, here we are predicting
    the dining trends in India for 2012. Now make that usual platter of yours special!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Dining%20trends/Spicy-Food.jpg"
        title="Hot n Spicy" alt="" style="max-height: 150px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;THE '&lt;i&gt;GARMA GARAM&lt;/i&gt;' CONCEPT&lt;/strong&gt;: Indian food habits have indeed
    come a long way. From those garam garam paranthas, we have learnt to appreciate
    cornflakes with cold milk for our breakfast. But this passionate mix and match of
    flavors do not come true with every household. We might still crave for that steaming
    bowl of poha or dosas for our breakfast. Our prediction says that Indians will not
    get over with the garam garam concept, not this year at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Dining%20trends/apple_logo_rainbow_fruit.jpg"
        title="Fruits" alt="" style="max-height: 200px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;FRUIT CONSUMPTION&lt;/strong&gt;: Our 2012 prediction says that the chomp-chomp
    sound might still be on an all-time-high. By this we mean, the fast-food consumption
    does not seem to decrease. However, we do see a lot of fruit consumption on the
    table this season. Many exotic fruits are being imported this year and guilty people
    will purge themselves of their sins by taking a bite or two!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Dining%20trends/rice.jpg" title="Rice n Curry"
        alt="" style="max-height: 150px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;RICE IT UPTO THE BRIM&lt;/strong&gt;: Burrrp factor. When it comes to India, our
    gastronomy has always been our priority. And it is not something new. Started with
    the Mughals, it is a tradition to overeat and maybe even threaten guests with another
    ladle full of steamed rice and curry. Well, this is what makes the dining experience
    in India complete.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Dining%20trends/wine.jpeg" title="Wine and Dine"
        alt="" style="max-width: 200px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;BEER BUBBLES CALLING?&lt;/strong&gt; : Let us hail Bacchus this year. With a good
    kick start to the New Year, the fun and frolic is just setting in. Some are still
    suffering from their year en ds while some are still grappling with their last year
    targets at work. How would this affect your appetite? For most, it would be all
    about wine and other ethanol products!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SHARE IT, SAVE THE BUCK&lt;/strong&gt;: Recovering from the hard-hit reality.
            With the budget comes the price-rise monster. So does that mean people would stop
            dining out and cut corners? Nah! Indians would still be in their comfort zone. But
            the difference being, they would order a plate and share.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;GO GLOBAL&lt;/strong&gt;: Every individual would be talking global this season.
            And you wonâ€™t remain unaffected by it for long. People will open up to global cuisines
            and multi-cuisine restaurants will be the most infested place on earth for hoggers
            and progressive experimentalists. Now, have you tasted Galantine yet?&lt;br /&gt;
            Let us glorify food and its chamber of secrets this year and marinate ourselves
            in that Epicurean feast!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
