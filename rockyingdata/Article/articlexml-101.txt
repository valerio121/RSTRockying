    &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;fter talking about how many famous movies were actually based on books in
    &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/93"&gt;Books on The Big Screen: 1&lt;/a&gt;, here’s another
    dose of blockbusters that have their scripts based on best sellers.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;1. JURASSIC PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/jurassic%20park%20-%20book.jpg"

            title="Jurassic Park The Movie" alt="" style="float: right; height: 200px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    A landmark movie in the history of computer generated images; Jurassic Park is based
    on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. The film went on to be a huge
    success and was followed by two sequels. A fourth installment is on the works and
    is due for release in 2013. The movie enthralled moviegoers with the amazing visual
    effects and the sound and effects for which it also took away the Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/bridget%20jones%20-%20book.jpg"

        BRIDGET JONES DIARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/bridget%20jones%20-%20movie.jpg"

    The book of the same name by Helen Fielding was written in the personal diary form
    and went to be a huge success by having sold over two million copies. The movie
    did complete justice to the spirit of the book and went to be just as successful.
    The story traces a peep into the life of a single, overweight thirty something British
    single girl who obsesses over her love life, her indulgence in alcohol and cigarettes
    and her sarcastic and humorous outlook on life as a whole. But despite “all odds”
    she goes on to tackle it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            title="Pride N Prejudice The Movie" alt="" style="height: 200px; float: right;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Another British themed book and novel which still manages to win hearts even after
    years of being published. The classic Jane Austen novel was turned into a reel version
    twice - in 1940 and in 2005. Telling the story of headstrong Elizabeth Bennett and
    her romantic interest Mr. Darcy the story reflects on the class system and inheritance
    during the early Georgian England. The movie is remembered for its strong characters
    and even wonderful portrayals.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/narnia%20-%20book.jpg"
            title="Narnia The Book" alt="" style="height: 200px; float: left;"&gt;4. CHRONICLES
        OF NARNIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/narnia%20-%20movie.jpg"
            title="Narnia The Movie" alt="" style="height: 200px; float: right;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The series of fantasy films have been based on the fantasy novels by C.S.Lewis.
    So far, three movies have been made and each one seems to be better than the last.
    The book is a narrative of adventures of children in the fictional world of Narnia
    guided by Aslan, a talking lion and the true king of Narnia. The movies are one
    of the highest grossing movie of all times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/harry%20potter%20-%20book.jpg"
            title="Harry Potter Book" alt="" style="height: 200px; float: left;"&gt;5. HARRY
        POTTER SERIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movies%20on%20books%20II/harry%20potter%20-%20movie.jpg"
            title="Harry Potter Movie" alt="" style="height: 200px; float: right;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Who could ever forget the magic that J.K. Rowling has weaved through the enigmatic
    Harry Potter series. The book, like Chronicles of Narnia, are a compilation of seven
    fantasy novels and have been all translated to the magic on the big screen. Each
    one of the movies have gone on to become the highest grossing movie of all times.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    So, here’s winding up our series on the best movies inspired by best sellers. There
    are just so many more than we would love to include but lack of space restrains
    us from doing so!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Do tell us what your favorite books are and whether you liked their reel adaptations
        or found them not “fulfilling” your imagination?&lt;/b&gt;
