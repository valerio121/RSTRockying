    &lt;b&gt;DOs&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Don'ts&lt;/b&gt; of eating?
    
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We bring to you the most common Myths and Facts about Weight loss. Read on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://rudrasofttech.com/rockying/art/Bananas.jpg" title="Bananas" alt=""
                style="max-height: 204px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Banana should not be consumed
                    if you’re trying to lose weight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Ripe banana is one of the best fruits to eat when attempting
            to lose weight. It is packet with nutrients providing sustained, substantial energy
            and checks on food cravings. Its mix of high potassium levels and low sodium content
            makes it the perfect food to help relieve water retention to laxatives.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: All Fats and oil are same.&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Fats and oils that occur naturally in food provide
            a concentrated source of energy and aid in the absorption off at-soluble vitamins
            A, D, E and K.&amp;nbsp;While unsaturated fats are beneficial when consumed in moderation,
            saturated and Trans fats are not. Consuming monounsaturated oils like Olive oil,
            Canola oil,Peanut oil seems to reduce total blood cholesterol and the ‘bad’ (low
            density lipo proteins [LDL]) cholesterol level without affecting the’ good’ (high
            density lipo
            &lt;img src="http://rudrasofttech.com/rockying/art/Olive%20Oil.jpg" title="Olive Oil"
                alt="" style="width: 171px; float: left; height: 217px;"&gt;protein [HDL]) cholesterol
            levels. Polyunsaturated oils, such as safflower and Sunflower, Walnut, Corn and
            Soybean oils, reduce total cholesterol and LDL,and also decrease HDL. Still, some
            polyunsaturated oil is necessary to obtain essential fatty acids.Saturated fat and
            Tran’s fat raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart related
            disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: Any one type of oil is best for cooking.&lt;br/&gt;
                Fact: &lt;/strong&gt;No oil can be called ideal. All vegetable oil used cooking contain
            a combination saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in varying proportion.
            It is beneficial to consume a mix of oils in order to maintain a balance between
            the three fatty acids.
            &lt;br/&gt;
            Ensure oil rotation by changing the oil you use every 15 days to get blend of all
            fatty acids or you could have a blend of oils. For example, you could use olive
            oil for salads and soybean oil for other cooking purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: Potatoes are fattening.&lt;img src="http://rudrasofttech.com/rockying/art/potatoes.jpg"
                title="Potatoes" alt="" style="width: 217px; float: right; height: 217px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Potatoes are an excellent food for people on weight loss. High
            in complex carbohydrates, potatoes fill you up long before they make you fat. It
            is only when you add fat to them- butter, cheese or cream that you turn them into
            a fattening food. Potatoes contain a cocktail of nutrients including B vitamins,
            potassium and fiber most of which is in the skin. Baking potatoes with the skin
            is the best way to get the most nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: Low-fat or no-fat means no calories.&lt;br/&gt;
                Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; A low-fat or nonfat food is often lower in calories than the
            same size portion of the full-fat product. But many processed low-fat or nonfat
            foods have just as many calories. They may contain added sugar, flour or starch
            thickeners to improve flavor and texture after fat is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: Nuts are fattening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img src="http://rudrasofttech.com/rockying/art/nuts.jpg"
                title="Nuts" alt="" style="max-height: 190px" class="pull-left" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Fact: &lt;/strong&gt;In small amounts, nuts can be a part of a healthy weight-loss
            program. They contain substantial amounts of Omega3 fatty acids which help in lowering
            bad cholesterol and increasing good cholesterol. Nuts are also good source of Protein,
            Dietary fiber and minerals. Nuts are good when consumed in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: One can lose weight while eating whatever one wants.&lt;/strong&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Fact: &lt;/strong&gt;To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat.
            You have to limit the number of calories you eat everyday and/or increase your daily
            physical activity to effectively lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Myth: Exercise makes one hungrier.&lt;br/&gt;
                Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise is actually an effective appetite suppressant. It will,
            however, make you thirsty because you will perspire. That is why you need to drink
            water before, during and after exercise. If you eat instead of drinking in order
            to rehydrate, or if you consume energy and sports drinks, then you might end up
            negating the effect of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, before you take drastic steps in order to target weight loss; learn to differentiate
    myths from facts otherwise you might end up doing more bad than good to your health.&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
