  <Text>How do you spell that? http://planetsuzy.fun/ planetsuzy hd  It&amp;#39;s our philosophy that dads can be just as nurturing, capable, and confident as moms. I am far from perfect in my role as a father - I lose my temper, get impatient, too structured, don&amp;#39;t do the laundry, and fail miserably, often. It&amp;#39;s the most challenging job I have ever encountered as well as the most rewarding. I&amp;#39;ve truly come to embrace my role as an at home dad and realize how fortunate I am to be so actively engaged in my child&amp;#39;s life. This is quite different than my own father who was in a generation where dads as &amp;quot;provider&amp;quot; meant earning the money....and never changed a diaper in his life.</Text>
