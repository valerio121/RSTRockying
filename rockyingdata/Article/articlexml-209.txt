  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
        They look gross, are pretty dumb and their vocabulary is limited to different kinds
        of growling alone, but zombies are always fun! Over several decades these undead
        have always entertained their audience with their own brand of low-intelligence,
        fast paced high entertainment. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
        take on the absolute best of zombie entertainment. Prepare to get Zombified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul style="list-style-type: none;"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Resident Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Zombified/Resident-Evil.jpg" alt="Resident Evil" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The big daddy of the zombie universe. Almost a dozen games across three platforms
                that gave rise to six movies and counting and yet this zombie masterpiece shows
                no signs of slowing down. The movies are fast paced with stylized action and even
                though one might feel that off late they are rehashing the same old stuff, there
                is always the lovely Milia Jovovich to stare at!!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                28 Days Later&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Zombified/28_Days_later.jpg"
                alt="28 Days Later" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Pure zombie horror, this Brit flick is a treat for those who love their movies scary.
                Directed by the famous Danny Boyle (of “Slumdog” fame) it is a disturbing and bloody
                flick in the true tradition of the zombie genre.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Night of the Living Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Zombified/N-O-T-L-D.jpg"
                alt="Night of the Living Dead" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                A B-grade 1968 flick in this list? Don’t be amazed, for this George A Romero directed
                flick not only made him a star director overnight but is also credited with having
                started the whole zombie-horror movie genre. A good old fashioned horror flick,
                you should forget the polish and special effects of modern cinema for a while and
                enjoy this slice of zombie history for a change!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
            Zombieland&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Zombified/Zombie-Land.jpg"
                alt="Zombieland" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                It is a ride across a wasted America with a neurotic teenager, a vengeful redneck
                and a pair of street smart sisters and is definitely one of the wittiest features
                in this list. Stylish, intelligent and surprisingly funny, this 2009 movie is a
                pure entertainer.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                I Am Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Zombified/I-Am-Legend.jpg"
                    alt="I Am Legend" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Based on the Richard Matheson novel of the same name this is a zombie movie with
                    a difference. It is not the blood thirsty zombies who hold the center stage but
                    a solid, praiseworthy performance by the charismatic Will Smith. He is fantastic
                    as the “last man on earth“and gives this 2007 movie an identity of its own. For
                    those who are already fans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhY2-D3Lwto&amp;feature=related"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
                    for an alternate ending which not many in India have seen yet!
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; Keeping her eyes closed, with long breaths and a gentle sound many mistake for snoring, actually helps Sonali think better. Or so she says. People question about these daily “thinking sessions”, mostly conducted on a comfortable couch or bed, while she claims that the long overdue best-seller she’s been working on (for quite some time now) will silence all the cynics. Till then she dreams on...
