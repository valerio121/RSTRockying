                    They are occult, they are mystical, they are supernaturally fantastic...The Hollywood
                    Super Heroes.&lt;/h5&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    IRON MAN&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/Iron-Man-Wallpaper.jpg"
                    title="Iron Man" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    An actual man made super hero. Yes, the super powers are all due to mechanical brilliance
                    of his arc reactor (or the mechanical heart) and the suit of armor. Tony Stark being
                    the head honcho of Stark Industries makes the suit of armor to plan his escape from
                    a terrorist group. Not only does he go back safe but he goes back with the idea
                    and conception of Iron Man.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    HULK&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/The-hulk.jpg"
                    title="The Hulk" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                        The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets. That byline is enough to explain that
                        one shouldn't anger the Hulk, the extremely impulsive and destructive alter ego
                        of reserved psychiatrist Bruce Banner. The Hulk is "born" after Dr. Bruce is accidentally
                        exposed to a blast of a gamma bomb test detonation. And thus, when angered, Dr.
                        Bruce turns into the huge, angry green monster.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    BATMAN&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/Batman.Wallpaper.jpg"
                    title="Batman" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                        Having seen his parents murdered by criminals, Bruce Wayne swore that he would fight
                        crime and he donned the Bat costume to do so. The only super hero without actual
                        super powers; he uses his intelligence, his defense skills, his martial arts skills
                        and other much believable tactics to fight crime.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    SPIDER MAN&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/spiderman.jpg"
                    title="Spider Man" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Bit by a radio active spider and thus achieving his spider like traits of climbing
                    and clinging, Spider Man remains one of the most lovable super heroes. Armed with
                    the ability to fly high, to cling to surfaces and to make web devices to ease his
                    crime fighting, Spider Man a.k.a. Peter Parker became the hope and aspiration for
                    every lonely, troubled teenager across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    SUPER MAN&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/Superman.jpg"
                    title="Superman" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The super hero to be born on another planet (Krypton) and being transferred by his
                    father to Earth moments before Krypton's destruction. Probably that is what explains
                    why he wear his underwear over his pants.... he is from another planet! Super Man
                    as the name suggests uses his superhuman abilities to save humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    CAPTAIN AMERICA
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/captain-america.jpg"
                    title="Captain America" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Steve Rogers, a frail young man reaches the peak of human perfection through an
                    advanced serum. This is basically in order to aid the wartime efforts of his country.
                    Donning a costume that resembles the US flag, he becomes Captain America, not having
                    super powers but is transformed from a frail, thin man to a man of physical perfection.
                    His strength, agility, speed, reflexes are at the zenith of what a human can possess.
                    The super hero who cannot fall sick or be intoxicated by drugs, alcohol or come
                    under the effect of hypnotic gases.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    WONDER WOMAN&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/Wonder-Woman-Wallpaper.jpg"
                    title="Wonder Woman" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The woman from the fictional city of Themyscira, Wonder Woman does it all - flies,
                    access to magical weaponry, extreme speed, agility and endurance and is resistant
                    to magical powers. The ideal woman of today!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    BLACK WIDOW&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Super%20heroes/the_avengers_black_widow%20%281%29.jpg"
                    title="Black Widow" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Usually working as an ally, Black Widow is another lady who has got it all. Extreme
                    expertise at martial arts, athletic skills, espionage training and yes, ladies,
                    slowed ageing - one trait every woman would definitely want!
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
