&lt;h3&gt;But First, Create Itinerary:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing to do when in Australia is creating a list of places and things you want to try. Having everything handy will help you enjoy the most. So, create an itinerary and make your experience smooth. Here’s how you can start: If you plan to visit Australia’s wildlife, spare at least 10 days to enjoy to the fullest. If not, plan at least a 10-day trip to witness the country’s most famous places. Spend 2-3 days on the coasts, perfect for family and couples. Australia has myriad beaches you can try out for water skiing or even just relaxing and soaking! Explore self-drive journeys, plan road trips, and visit the lush greens, theme parks, and spas. Wow! Pumped-up already? Let's go! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Aaah! Water Surfing! &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Summer-adventure-in-Australia/Water-Skiing-in-Australia.jpg" alt="Water Skiing in Australia" title=""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surfing is always on the top of the bucket list of travelers! It’s thrilling, enticing and the best thing to do on a sunny beach. Just get your surfboard and get along the waves. Get your &lt;a href="https://www.waterskiersconnection.com.au/" alt="ski tubes" title="ski tubes Australia" target="_blank"&gt;ski tubes&lt;/a&gt; to surf on water and get going!
