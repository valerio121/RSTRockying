  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    What comes to your mind when we say beautiful buildings? Do you instantly think
    of Taj Mahal or the Red Fort or the Pantheon? A hundred years ago, naming the most
    breathtaking building was easy. But not anymore! With so many choices to pick from,
    we had a tough time picking out the choicest. But here you go, feast your eyes to
    some of the most wonderful architecture from across the globe with a little bit
    about each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Burj Al Arab, Dubai&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/burj-al-arab-Exterior_drago.jpg"
            style="height: 500px;" alt="Burj Al Arab Exterior" /&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/burj-al-arab-interior.jpeg"
            style="height: 500px;" alt="Burj Al Arab interior" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Opened in 1999 and often referred to as the world’s seven star hotel (though often
            debated), Burj Al Arab is the fourth tallest hotel in the world. Standing at 321
            m (1053 ft), the hotel is located on its own private island and is connected to
            the mainland via a private curving bridge. Shaped like a dhow (a sailing vessel),
            the hotel boasts of one of the most beautiful atrium standing at 180 m tall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision, Netherlands&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/I-O-S-A-V-Netherlands.jpg"
            alt="Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision" style="height: 370px;" /&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Conceived as a perfect cube, half of which is underground, this building is the
            storehouse of the largest audiovisual archives of Europe. The structure’s panels
            are imprinted with famous images from Dutch television: the justice minister riding
            his bicycle, say, Johan Cruyff scoring a goal. Using computer technology, the architect
            ran the images together and baked them into the glass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            St Mark’s Square, Venice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/st-marks-square.jpg"
            alt="St. Mark's Square in Venice" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Piazza.jpg"
            alt="Piazza" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Piazza San Marco, known as St. Mark’s Square in English or more popularly as the
            Piazza, this is the public square in Italy. Described by Napoleon as the “most beautiful
            drawing room”, the piazza is a grand structure and stands beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            The Guggenheim, Bilbao Spain&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Guggenheim-Spain.JPG"
            alt="The Guggenheim, Bilbao Spain" style="height:300px;" /&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/The-Guggenheim-Bilbao-Spain.jpg" alt="The Guggenheim, Bilbao Spain" style="height:300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When this building was opened in 1997, it was described as the most important building
            of its time. Built of limestone, glass and titanium, the museum features exhibitions
            organized by the Guggenheim Foundation and by the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, as well
            as selections from the permanent collection of the Guggenheim Museums. Built along
            the Nervion River, this museum is often referred to as the most important work since
            the 1980s, among architectural experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Hagia Sophia, Istanbul&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Hagia-Sofia.jpg"
            alt="Hagia Sophia, Istanbul" style="height:350px;" /&gt;

            alt="Interiors of Hagia Sophia, Istanbul" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Initially started as a Church, then a mosque and now a museum, this building is
            the epitome of old world charm in Istanbul. One of the greatest surviving example
            of the Byzantine architecture, its interiors is decorated with mosaic and marbles
            and coverings of great artisitic value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Shwedagon Pagoda, Myanmar&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Shwedagon-Pagoda.jpg"
            alt="Shwedagon Pagoda in Myanmar" style="height:350px;" /&gt;

            alt="Aerial views of Shwedagon Pagoda in Myanmar" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The oldest historical pagoda, standing for over 2,600 years, the pagoda is 99 mts
            high and dominates the skyline of the city. It is the most sacred Buddhist pagodas
            and the gold seen on the stupa is made of genuine gold plates, covering the brick
            structure and attached by traditional rivets. People from Myanmar and monarchs from
            all over have donated to have the gold setup and for it to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            King Ludwig’s Castle, Bavaria&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/King-Ludwigs-Castle.jpg"
            alt="King Ludwig’s Castle in Bavaria" style="height:250px;" /&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/King-Ludwigs-Castle2.jpg"

        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/ludwigs-castle.jpg"
            alt="King Ludwig’s Castle in Bavaria" style="height:250px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Famously known as the Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, Kind Ludwig’s Castle or Neuschwanstein
            Castle is every girl’s dream castle. Built under the commission of Ludwig II, King
            of Bavaria, in the 19th century; this palace was far from built when Ludwig died.
            Though an incomplete structure (according to the original plan) this castle attracts
            over 1.3 million visitors every year. The majestic exteriors makes in one of the
            most popular attraction of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            Sistine Chapel, Rome&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Sistine-Chapel.jpg"
            alt="Sistine Chapel in Rome Italy" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The official residence of the Pope in the Vatican City, the Sistine Chapel is best
            known for its ceiling. The ceiling which is probably one of the greatest works of
            Michelangelo, took about four years to complete. The painted area of the ceiling
            is about 40 m (131 ft) long by 13 m (43 ft) wide. This means that Michelangelo painted
            well over 5,000 square feet (460 m2) of frescoes. To understand the full impact
            and beauty of this structure, one has to read this quote which sums it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h6&gt;
            "Without having seen the Sistine Chapel one can form no appreciable idea of what
            one man is capable of achieving." -- Johann Wolfgang Goethe, 23 August 1787&lt;/h6&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            The Taj Mahal&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/taj.jpg" alt="The Taj Mahal in India" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We cannot do a list of beautiful buildings without mentioning India’s pride - The
            Taj Mahal. Known for its beauty for the love, Taj Mahal is the epitome of Mughal
            architecture. Built as a tribute, Taj Mahal is a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, wife of
            emperor Shah Jahan, the centre of Taj Mahal is the tomb of both of them. The minarets
            are over 130 ft high and every aspect of the structure has elements of Persian architecture
            in it. With over 20 years required to build the monument of love, this beauty is
            definitely one to lay eyes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            The Pantheon, Rome&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/Pantheon.jpg"
            alt="The Pantheon in Rome Italy" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Most-Beautiful-Buildings/pantheon_aerial_view.jpg"
            alt="Aerial view of Pantheon in Rome Italy" style="height:350px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A Roman Temple built for the Gods of Ancient Rome, Pantheon is over 2000 years old.
            The dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The
            only source of light is the interior is the entry door and the oculus (or the circular
            hole at the apex of the dome). Two kings and a queen of Italy are buried in the
            Pantheon. It is one of the marvels of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    What remains to be understood is that there so many more which could have made it
    to the list. As they say, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Do tell us what
    your favorites among the list or any that you would like to mention. &lt;strong&gt;And if
        you got the time and money go visit them and find out for yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
