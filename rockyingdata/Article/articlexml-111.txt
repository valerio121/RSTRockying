Talk about rewriting history––or shall we say literature?!&lt;/p&gt;</Description>
  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    From the 1970s, when Amitabh ruled the roost as the undisputed no. 1 which led the
    industry pundits to brand him as one-man industry till recently where the industry
    has come to be dominated by the three Khans, Bollywood sure has come a long way;
    and how! We as audiences have lapped up everything and have been asking for more,
    whether it was Sridevi’s thunder thighs in Himmatwala or the Disco era heralded
    by Mithun and his gunmaster G9 avatar (1980s), the return of the love story with
    the dew drop innocence of Salman &amp;amp; Bhagyashree (MPK) and Aamir and Juhi (QSQT)
    , Shahrukh’s obsessive fixation in Darr or his later we-won’t-rebel-yet-our-love-will-triumph
    formula in DDLJ (1990s) to the post-2000 era which saw the emergence of star kids
    like Hritik and Abhishek, and&amp;nbsp; a host of new faces along with the continuing
    rein of Shahrukh, Salman and Aamir.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img style="width: 700px;" title="Recent Experimental Bollywood Cinema" alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Experimental%20bollywood/Exp.BollywoodCollage.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    However, in the midst of all the glamour, glitz and star power, a new crop of filmmakers––experimental
    and innovative––decided to give a good name to the hitherto unprofitable parallel
    cinema with which Bollywood experimented briefly in the late 70s and 80s.These filmmakers
    like &lt;strong&gt;Anurag Kashyap&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dibakar Banerji&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Soojit
        Sarkar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ram Gopal Varma&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Abhinay Deo&lt;/strong&gt;––some
    of whom came from the ad world while the rest simply wanted to experiment with original
    and creative ideas––have redefined Bollywood as never before; and it’s still a work
    in progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, we find a neo-noir &lt;strong&gt;Dev D&lt;/strong&gt;, where Paro is a woman who’s unbridled
    in her sexual expression and a Devdas who finally doesn’t turn out to be such big
    loser; who actually matures and settles down with Chanda. Talk about rewriting history––or
    shall we say literature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As &lt;strong&gt;Oye Lucky Lucky Oye&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Khosla ka Ghosla&lt;/strong&gt;, with
    their rib-tickling Punjabi and Haryanvi treatment, kept us in splits, we didn’t
    fail to notice the genius of the former Bengali Adman, Dibakar Banerji, who takes
    pride in calling himself a part-time Punjabi and a freelance Haryanvi! R. Balki
    dared to give a pony tail to the 60-something Amitabh and cast him opposite a much
    younger tabu and offered us a culinary delight that still waters our mouth whenever
    we see his light-hearted and heart-warming &lt;strong&gt;Cheeni Kum&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    RGV may have subjected us to an occasional and unbearable ‘Aag’, but India’s &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/david-benrimon-fine-art-andy-warhol-experimenting-with-fame-the-tps" target="_blank"&gt;
        Andy Warhol&lt;/a&gt;, as his fans call him, too has walked the road less travelled
    with the likes of Company, &lt;strong&gt;Nishabd&lt;/strong&gt; and the witty no-brainer &lt;strong&gt;
        Daud&lt;/strong&gt;! He may be down right now, yet he’s one man we can’t write off––not
    yet! With Department expected to hit the cinemas this year, we never know what the
    maverick has in store for us. Though a lot of conservative eyebrows were raised
    and purist cheeks went red on hearing the expletives in &lt;strong&gt;Delhi Belly&lt;/strong&gt;,
    most of us fell on the floor laughing while watching Abhinay Deo’s brave attempt
    that caught our pulse as very few movies have done in the recent past.
    &lt;img style="width: 304px; height: 198px; float: right; padding-left:10px;" title="Anuraag Kashyap's Upcoming Gangs Of Wasseypur"
        alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Experimental%20bollywood/Gangs-of-wasseypur%5B1%5D.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    And the good news is that this trend shows no signs of stopping. So, for every high-budget
    Dabbang or Bodyguard, in which Salman takes off his shirt, there is an experimental
    &lt;strong&gt;Phans Gaye Re Obama&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;Bheja Fry&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We’re
    not complaining at all and are, in fact, already waiting eagerly for Dibakar Banerji’s
    &lt;strong&gt;Shanghai&lt;/strong&gt;, Anurag Kashyap’s &lt;strong&gt;Gangs of Wasseypur&lt;/strong&gt;
    and Vishal Bhardwaj’s &lt;strong&gt;Matru ki Bijli ka Mandola&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="rstquestion"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FUN QUIZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;
           Which of the following females played a negative character in &lt;i&gt;Phans Gae Re Obama&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Lara Dutta&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li data-anwser="correct"&gt;Neha Dhupia&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Sarika&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Diana Hayden &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Knowing these guys, we don’t think we’ll be disappointed. Rockying says,
    we the audience, are only asking for more! Aren't we?
