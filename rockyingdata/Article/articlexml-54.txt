  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    Moving ahead with our travel interview series (the first being &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/47"&gt;
        Maui&lt;/a&gt;), we caught up with Muriel who visited the beautiful Udaipur. Read
    on to discover her exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a title="Muriel Jacques" href="http://www.frenchyummymummy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;
        Muriel Jacques&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a French-born British resident. She has been an avid
    traveler and is always on the lookout for an excuse to travel yet again. Her most
    memorable visit has been her trip to the wonderful royal &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Udaipur&lt;/i&gt; in Rajasthan,
        India.&lt;/b&gt; Since then she is fascinated by everything Indian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    About me&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I am a self-proclaimed French-born Yummy Mummy. I caught the travel bug when I was
    23 when going to Bali for the first time. I have traveled at every possible opportunity,
    for work or for vacations. For some reason, I feel happy when I travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    My special travel destination&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A place that blew me away was &lt;a title="Udaipur" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udaipur"
        target="_blank"&gt;Udaipur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title="Rajasthan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan"
            target="_blank"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt; This was my first trip to India and I actually
    wasn’t too pleased to go because I was following my husband, who at the time was
    working for an Indian company and had a work seminar while all the spouses were
    supposed to visit Rajasthan together. I thought that it was going to be a bit of
    a bore. I couldn’t have been more wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Udaipur/Hotel-Lake-Palace.jpg"
    title="Lake Palace Hotel" alt="" style="width: 800px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The landscapes were stunning. To top it up, we were staying at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Palace"&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;lake Palace &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Palace"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hotel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
    in the middle of &lt;b&gt;lake Pichola&lt;/b&gt;. You had to travel by boat to get to the hotel.
    It was where the James Bond movie “Octopussy” had been shot, and I am a huge James
    Bond fan. To me, it is simply the best hotel in the world. The white building seemed
    to float on the water. The food was fantastic. As it kept coming in small pieces,
    I was eating all the time. But the best part of the trip was that I was the only
    European woman, and I got to talk to all the Indian wives. They explained to me
    what their religion was about and we visited a&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Ganesh temple&lt;/b&gt; (Ganesh
    has an elephant’s head and is known as the Obstacles remover). We all seem to be
    very comfortable with each other’s company quite soon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Places I visited&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Udaipur/Lake-Hotel-Palace-Interior.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;
    We drove around quite a lot and went to the &lt;b&gt;Monsoon Palace&lt;/b&gt;, the summer residence
    of the Maharajas. It was huge and all the objects were fantastic and very colorful.
    In one of the rooms, a huge peacock was drawn on the wall. It was bright yellow
    and blue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, who could miss the shopping in Udaipur. I bought lots
    of &lt;b&gt;embroidered scarves&lt;/b&gt; to give to friends and family and also fell for a
    little &lt;b&gt;silver elephant&lt;/b&gt;, beautifully carved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    The best time to be there&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Udaipur/monsoon_palace_.jpg"
        title="Monsoon Palace" alt="" style="width: 400px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;The
    best time to go to Udaipur is between September and March if you want to avoid the
    heavy rains of the monsoon and the tropical heat of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Financial Issues&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All types of hotels and guest-houses can be found in Udaipur. Pick the one that
    falls within your budget. I would recommend, wherever you stay, to go to the Lake
    palace Hotel for a meal or a drink even if you are not staying there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    One special tidbit&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    While in Udaipur, a fortuneteller told me that I was a very spiritual person (which
    came to a surprise to be as I would like to think that I am quite pragmatic!) and
    that I should consider fortunetelling as a new career. I haven’t acted upon his
    recommendation yet.&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
