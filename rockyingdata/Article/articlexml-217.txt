  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    10th October is World Mental Health Day. The day raises awareness and promotes open
    discussion about mental illnesses and related problems. We’ve talked about mental
    health quite a few times - &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/193"&gt;Brain ageing&lt;/a&gt;,
    Depression (the theme for this year's Mental Health Day), Truths about &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/92"&gt;
        Mental Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/84"&gt;Brain Exercises&lt;/a&gt;. But this time we get down to the fundamentals of mental peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Mental-Health-Day/Mental-Health-Day.jpg"
    alt="" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    WHO claims that India is the depression capital of the world - a statistic that psychiatrists in India don’t agree to. However, in our country, the statistics are disturbing - suicide rates are high, the elderly are clearly depressed and people are falling under a lot of stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So we get down to the basics of depression and its causes, i.e. deterring mental
    health. Maintaining a good mental health means having a sense of well being, being
    able to function well in everyday life and feeling confident about yourself and
    your actions. It means to strike a balance in every aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Now it is tough but we touch upon the basics of improving and maintaining your mental
    health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            CONNECT, CONNECT, CONNECT&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There is a world outside Facebook, Twitter and the ‘World Wide Web’. Real life connections
            make much more sense and will help you in many ways. Put a little effort and time
            into relationships that matter and reach out to people. Not only does it make verbal
            communication enjoyable, it helps you in building stronger relationships and a support
            system.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You wouldn’t want that you have 5 people attending your funeral when you actually
            had 2000 facebook friends, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            Heard and said a thousand times : TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
        &lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The most under-rated of the most important things to health care. A lot of us ignore
            minor pains and aches and wait for it to get the better of us. Go for regular health
            check ups and make sure you take care of your bodily health which in turn keeps
            mental problems at bay. Nourish your body and your mind well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            TAKE A BREAK&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When was the last time you took time away for just yourself? Not just a vacation
            but kept time away from the daily grind. Break the routine. Do something that you
            enjoy - read a book, go for a quiet dinner, listen to music. Make sure you have
            a vacation once in a while to break the monotony and give your mind some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Take a day off in lieu of the mental health day!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            PRIORITIZE&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Figure out what needs to be done now and what can be put off for later. This is
            what we call &lt;b&gt;creative-procrastination&lt;/b&gt; (Yes! we are human beings and we procrastinate
            no matter what). Just train yourself to delay the least important tasks while finish
            the most important ones the first thing. Also, too much of multitasking can make
            it quite confusing. Not only will it take a toll on your physical well being, it
            might create a lot of undue stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            MONEY MATTERS&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Keep your financial issues at bay. Sort out and keep it clear. Spend only as much
            as you can afford. Indulge only when you can, not because you want to. Stay away
            from debts as far as possible. They are good now, but suck in the long term!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
          REACH OUT AND ASK&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You are no Superman. You will have problems. Someone else might be able to help.
            There is nothing wrong in it. Ask for help when you need it. You will be surprised
            by the amount of help people have to offer. This is again when the support system
            comes into picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            BE FIT, EXERCISE&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Probably another reason to get up and running! But yes, physical well being is closely
            related to mental well being. Not only does activity release hormones that help
            in balancing mood levels but exercise also helps in keeping fit and keeping various
            illnesses away. Exercise doesn’t necessarily have to be hitting the gym. It could
            be vacuuming, gardening, taking your dog out for a walk, cycling with your friends,
            going for a swim. Just be active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            VOLUNTEER&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There is nothing like helping others in need. Not only does it give you a sense
            of fulfillment but it gives meaning to your being and living. Reach out, help someone
            in need, donate your old stuff, donate a book, help your neighbor, just about anything
            that will make a difference to others’ lives. Remember? “The Self-less Act of Redemption”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
           BOREDOM AT BAY&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Don’t let monotony settle in. It tires the brain and makes it a devil’s workshop!
            Keep yourself involved and make sure your “brain” is on &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/84"&gt;
                activity mode&lt;/a&gt;. Solve puzzles, work on your vocabulary, learn a language,
            challenge yourself, try the crosswords.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
          ALCOHOL, CIGARETTES, DRUGS&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The ads say it right. They make it tough for you. Try to keep your alcohol intake
            to a minimum and &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/72"&gt;cut down on smoking&lt;/a&gt;
            as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            SLEEP WELL&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If you haven’t taken your required rest for the day, then go ahead and do it. A
            sleep recharges your batteries, makes the mind fresh and makes you much more productive.
            And yes, it helps &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/46"&gt;reduce weight&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here’s to a good mental health for a much more satisfying, meaningful and a healthier
    lifestyle. It doesn’t require much effort - just a little discipline and a little
    care and it will go a long run in making life much more easier and fun always!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    What are you doing to keep your body and mind healthy?&lt;/h5&gt;</Text>
