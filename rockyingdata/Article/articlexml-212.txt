&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Pondicherry/Sri-Aurobindo-Ashram-Collage.jpg"
    alt="SRI AUROBINDO ASHRAM" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Sri Aurobindo Ashram, founded in 1920, is where Sri Aurobindo and revered ‘Mother’
    spent the most part of their lives. This place is the saddle of peace and harmony.
    Home to Sri Aurobindo’s ideas of peaceful community, this ashram comprises of many
    buildings and the inmates are a diversified community of around 1,200 members engaged
    in various activities like farms, libraries, gardens, and small-scale industries
    like printing press.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    AUROVILLE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A real example of community living Auroville is conceived as an experimental “universal
    town”. This township is home to people with different nationalities, beliefs and
    culture dwelling here in harmony. This amazing city of community living was started
    in 1968 by Maa , ‘the Mother’ (A French lady, Mirra Alfassa)a renowned disciple
    of Shri Aurobindo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A major attraction here is the Matrimandir, the spiritual heart of Auroville.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;BEST TIME TO VISIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="//rockying.com/"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt; says that the best time to visit
    Pondicherry would be in the months of October to January. Occasional showers and
    a visible relief from the scorching heat, you would love this place. The roads are
    perfectly clean and walking alongside the pavement with an umbrella can simply inspire
    any ungrateful minds as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;TO DWELL AT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The city offers two kinds of accommodation for tourists: beach resorts or city hotels.
    However, city hotels are preferable if you wish to sink in the essence of a Pondi-city
    life with humble French-speaking people. However, we suggest do ample research on
    a stay which is closer to all tourist destinations. Check Hotel &lt;a href="http://www.hotelsurguru.com/rooms.html"&gt;
        Suguru&lt;/a&gt; out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/rockyingmag"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
    advises that Pondi beaches are not that safe because of its rocks and steep waves.
    Therefore, investing in beach resorts might leave a gaping hole in your pocket.
    Opt for city hotels. Walk around the city and keep a map handy!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Things to carry:&lt;/strong&gt; Easy guide to learning French, camera, slippers,
    umbrella, a light shawl and a torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Off-beat places to visit in the city:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A 150-year old lighthouse.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Serenity Beach.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Horse riding in Chunnambar backwaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    At times, it is best to let your mind stray from the humdrums of life. Pondicherry
    is the place that will leave you with numerous stories your mind would weave even
