    It has been criticized for its “killer fries”, for using beef and for being one
    of the reasons for obesity. But one thing's for sure, McDonald's
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Mc-Donalds/mc-d-fries.gif" title="Mc-Donalds-Fries"
        alt="" style="float: right;" height="193" width="148"&gt;still remains to fight
    all that controversy and hit right back and claims its spot as the number one hamburger
    fast food restaurant in the world. Serving over 68 million customers a day, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;
        Rockying&lt;/a&gt; gets behind a little of the McDonald magic.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

        width="568"&gt;Brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the McDonald business
    in 1940. The restaurant now has branches in over 199 countries, including the 56
    branches in India alone. Offering employment to about 1.5 million customers, McDonalds
    offers a variety of restaurant types - cafes, drive through, counter services, indoor
    and outdoor seating.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    One thing most lovable about McDonald is well, the menu. Offering just the “right”
    kind of food to entice the junk food lover in all of us. Having a wide range of
    selection from burgers, iced teas, ice creams, sundaes, sandwiches, salads and shakes,
    the brand just has hit the right notes in kids and adults alike.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The menu usually varies across countries and regions. For example, one extremely
    popular dish in India is the &lt;b&gt;Mc Aloo Tikki&lt;/b&gt; which isn’t found in countries
    elsewhere.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Claiming to be made of 100% pure ingredients, McDonald's has done a lot to create
    the balance for a healthier lifestyle. Seems like an irony given the fact that no
    health expert will actually advise you that McDonald's or the menu it serves is
    really “okay” if you are trying for a healthy lifestyle. Watch the film, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-eRXuuH9AI"&gt;
        Super Size Me&lt;/a&gt; to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here’s a look at the little claims that actually suggest that they might be bending
    towards a healthy outlook or so as to
    &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Food/Mc-Donalds/Mcaloo-tikki.jpg"
        title="McAloo Tikki" alt="" style="float: right; height: 300px;"&gt;say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The&lt;b&gt; oil used&lt;/b&gt; is said to be Canola blend. This makes the fried items into
        0 trans fat per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their meat are 100% &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome"&gt;
            USDA&lt;/a&gt; inspected.&lt;/b&gt; This helps in maintaining the quality and safety in terms
            of good meat consumption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every single &lt;b&gt;egg is inspected&lt;/b&gt;. Every egg is
                washed and inspected visually and electronically before they are ready for being
                used at the big M.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They offer &lt;b&gt;non fat milk for their McCafe coffee&lt;/b&gt; drinks.
                    You can always choose to go the non fat way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;McDonald’s Triple Thick Shakes,
                        Sundaes and McFlurry desserts use &lt;b&gt;reduced fat ice cream&lt;/b&gt;, which is made from
                        fresh quality cream, whole milk, and skim milk solids.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Their &lt;a href="http://www.mcdonaldsindia.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; offers a great deal on
    what really is going behind the McDonald's story and how it works. Videos, articles
    and stories about how the big M is trying to work out the healthy issues.
    &lt;br&gt;
    Having said all that, McDonalds, the largest food-chain in the world, still remains
    the most lip smacking burger and nuggets fest there is ever to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Though it may be a little tough on the hips, it would be wonderful on the lips.
    What do you say?
