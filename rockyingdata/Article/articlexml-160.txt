    old Cantonese proverb goes something like this:&lt;i&gt;"Anything that walks, swims, crawls,
        or flies with its back to heaven is edible&lt;/i&gt;". Well, the Chinese food in China
    has indeed been true to its sayings. But some extreme and spicy food fusion has
    been a welcoming change for us Indians!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    IT'S DIFFERENT !
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Indeed, Indians clearly do not like it bland and we being the curry kings desire
    our Chinese with a little tadka (tempering), a little spice and truck full of chilli.
    Did you know that the &lt;i&gt;chāu-mèing&lt;/i&gt;(originally spelt like this) we devour in
    India was first introduced by China Town in Calcutta? The Indian variant unashamedly
    introduces vegetarian ingredients in it such as cabbage, paneer, bamboo shots, pea
    pods and carrots. Original Chinese chowmein has no space for the veggies to settle
    in and is only consumed with pork and shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    So, most people from India who visit China for work or for leisure cannot eat Chinese
    food! We tell you why:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            All Chinese food cooked in China follow three cooking methods- heating, boiling,
            steaming and in some cases fried. So very little use of oil, as is evident. Phew!&lt;img

                title="Indo-Chinese Manchurian" alt="" style="width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese noodles are made of wheat which we consume in the form of breads and tortillas.
            Noodles in India are made of flour. Shocked???&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rice is used for seasoning in China. And all rice seasoning is sauce based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese mostly use animal fat such as the lard or peanut oil for cooking unlike
            us Indians who use mustard oil, sunflower oil, clarified butter or sesame oil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You will simply find no traces of curd or milk products in China’s gastronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;So the food art gets simple: The Chinese use seasonings, the Indians use spices
        and seasonings for a more elevated experience of food indulgence. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    HERE ARE SOME FUNNY FACTS ABOUT THE CHINESE FOOD CULTURE THAT MIGHT SET YOU LAUGHING:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Chutnification-of-chinese-food-in-india/cold_chinese_noodles.jpg"

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            People in China are fierce loyalists to their noodle preferences. How come we Indians
            go easy on that? Good that we are not Chinese enough in our consumption, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, the China versus America did not leave the food plate out of their purview
            it seems. America’s famous turkey has not been embraced by the Chinese at all! And
            funnily enough many Chinese bloggers call the turkey as “the big bird”!!! The reason?
            Turkey meat is bland and coarse for the Chinese folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Chinese have a weird way of consuming fish. Dipped in boiled water and brushed with
            oil and salt, they usually swallow the whole fish at one go and pull out the cleaned
            skeleton with the head and the tail hanging on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Also, here is what we feel about this food fusion. Read on for some interesting
    inputs:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The Chowmein&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot has been said about it. Let us leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Chilli Chicken&lt;/strong&gt;: Crucial dish to help you gobble some steamed rice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Pork and dried shrimp dumplings&lt;/strong&gt;: You cannot find this in India. Visit a Chinese
            lady for some lessons at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Chicken fried rice: &lt;/strong&gt;This is the best thing that has happened to the Indian
            Chinese platter!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We Indians sure do have our way of quick fixing food to suit our taste buds. Hail
    Chinese food, the Indian way of course!&lt;/p&gt;
