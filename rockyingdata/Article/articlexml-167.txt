    We all know not all health foods are tasty. If you are a late sleeper and a late
    riser (we suggest &lt;i&gt;Early to bed Early to rise&lt;/i&gt; though), you are typically one
    of those who are awake fighting hunger pangs bravely. If you are thinking what can
    keep you miles away from those unhealthy munches at midnight, this is a must read
    for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            I enjoy long walks to the refrigerator!&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, the refrigerator might be the most tempting storehouse of food but we suggest
            you try having a glass of &lt;b&gt;milk&lt;/b&gt; and a handful of &lt;b&gt;nuts&lt;/b&gt;, a &lt;b&gt;banana&lt;/b&gt;
            or simply some cold water. Try to de-clutter your mind from sinful indulgence in
            fattening foods.&lt;/p&gt;

            title="Milk and Nuts" alt="" /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            Microwave Pop! Corn.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This is the sexiest way of munching your way to glory. Pop-corns are high on roughage
            and totally fat free. You can snack it up without feeling bloated the next morning!&lt;/p&gt;

            title="Pop Corn" alt="" /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            Midnight Sandwich Love
        &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If you are looking for a real full meal then brown breads stuffed with yogurt, berries,
            a slice of ricotta cheese, sprouts and cucumber can create some sure shot midnight
            magic. Just prepare it once to know how heavenly it tastes like!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            Health Bars
        &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Do keep health bars at home. They are the best substitute for chocolate craving.
            Nutri bars are available in several flavors so you are free to take your pick and
            keep that sweet tooth under control. &lt;b&gt;Dates&lt;/b&gt; can be another great alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;
            That Gorgeous Mexican Roll!&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Mexican rolls can be a refreshing midnight snack. Trust us on this. Throw in some
            jalapenos, minced olives, grated carrots, finely chopped tomatoes, mustard and tomato
            sauce, onions and cottage cheese and roll it up in your good old tawa roti. You
            will thank us for this!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt;: Avoid high protein consumption during nights at all costs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Now you might just wait for the clock to strike 12, eh??&lt;/h4&gt;</Text>
