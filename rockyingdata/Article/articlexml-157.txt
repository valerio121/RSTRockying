  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    Its not clear whether many of us live to eat or eat to live. But one thing that
    is absolutely clear is that food is the source of all our energy. It is the fuel
    for the body. So, what’s more surprising is that how we tend to overlook the good
    food - food that can actually help us in keeping ourselves just as pretty and healthy
    as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt; looks into food that
    not only helps in keeping the mind and the body healthy, but keeps you glowing and
    pretty!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            MILK&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/Milk.jpg"
                title="Milk" alt="" style="max-height: 284px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
            We have heard our moms shouting and screaming and maybe even bribing us to drink
            that glass of milk. Here’s why mommy was right. Packed with Vitamin D and calcium,
            your healthy smile and strong bones have all being wanting milk for a long time.
            So, if you need to save yourself from brittle bones and broken tooth and keep the
            shining smile just as shiny; go drink a glass of milk right now!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            DARK CHOCOLATE&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/Dark_Chocolate.jpg"
                title="Dark Chocolate" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;From
            something “really boring” to something absolutely interesting - dark chocolate.
            Dark chocolate has been scientifically proven to increase endorphin levels which
            further leads to feeling of happiness. And happiness make your skin glow!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            CABBAGE&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/Foods.For.a.beautiful.U.jpg"
                title="Cabbage" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;One cup
            of chopped cabbage has just 22 calories. And it is loaded with nutrients one of
            which helps in producing cancer fighting enzymes thus reducing your risk of cancer.
            Just sprinkle some over your sandwiches and burgers for the satisfying yet healthy
            crunch.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            CURD&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/curd.jpg"
                title="Curd" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Probably a
            staple in an Indian household; curd is probably packed with more calcium than milk
            itself. A million and one ways to enjoy your cup of yogurt which not only help you
            in building strong bones but also keeps the skin hydrated. A must for summers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            TOMATOES&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/Tomatoes.jpg"
                title="Tomatoes" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
            Something to keep you young and to keep the wrinkles at bay. Tomatoes contain lycopene
            that help in reducing cell damage and redness of skin. In order for the anti wrinkle
            properties to work, make sure your tomatoes come with something fat. Or mix some
            extra-virgin olive oil in your tomato preparations to ease in lycopene absorption.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            WALNUTS&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/walnuts.jpg"
                title="Walnuts" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Not only
            are they a healthy snack option, they help in giving you strong nails. The vitamin
            B (Biotin) in walnuts is a good beauty enhancer that also helps in reducing signs
            of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            FISH&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/Fish.jpg"
                title="Fish" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;One of the
            richest source of Omega 3 fatty acids, seafood has been highly acclaimed among health
            experts. The omega 3 is good for complexion, for reducing inflammations, keeping
            dryness at bay and for improving circulation. Good circulation is necessary for
            healthy, glowing skin.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            VITAMIN C
        &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/vitamin-c.jpg"
                title="Vitamin C" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Yes,
            technically not a “food” but considering that it is the main ingredient in many
            beauty creams, we had to look into what makes it so special. Vitamin C helps in
            keeping the skin smooth and taut. Just make sure you are eating &lt;b&gt;veggies, berries,
                oranges, limes, guavas&lt;/b&gt; to keep the vitamin C content in check.&lt;b&gt; Citrus fruits&lt;/b&gt;
            in general do just the trick.
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            GREEN TEA&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/green_tea.jpg"
                title="Green Tea" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Probably
            the healthiest tea around; with practically no calories (don’t add sugar!) not only
            does green tea help keep the weight in check, it a good body cleanser and is a boost
            in washing away the toxins.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            WATER&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Foods-for-a-beautiful-you/water-mermaid.jpg"
                title="Water" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;No healthy
            food list is complete without water being mentioned. The one thing that will sustain
            you throughout and besides being the best cleanser, is the way to keep yourself
            hydrated and your mind and body alert. Make sure you drink at least 2 litres of
            water a day to keep everything working properly. Water is the fuel and the grease
            to your engines!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
