    your hair feel dry and frizzy even after you had oiled them the night before and
    shampooed them the next morning? Think before greasing your hair the next time.
    An ancient way of moisturizing your hair, hair oil has been there ever since. Herbal
    oils, medicated oils, perfumed ones, oils that would make your hair black, oils
    that would add shine to your hair, oils that stop baldness… is it all actually happening?
    If we go back in the history, our grandmothers and great grandmothers did have those
    sturdy long manes. So, how did they do it? Read on to find out why applying oil
    every time before shampoo remains only a &lt;strong&gt;myth&lt;/strong&gt; now:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Favorable Conditions for the Grand Mamas:
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The weather conditions were different and so was the quality of water. Today the
            water we use for washing our hair is full of chlorine content that promotes hair
            loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our great grandmothers never knew of &lt;strong&gt;hair straighteners, hair dryers and other hair
                mousses&lt;/strong&gt; that we use today to get the look we want to.&lt;img class="pull-right" style="max-height: 186px;"
                    title="Cars Cause Pollution" alt="car causing pollution" src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/Pollution_Cars.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Less temperature fluctuations and&lt;strong&gt; less pollution&lt;/strong&gt; levels. Oily strands are
            a huge turn off and can make you look like Ugly Betty! People with natural oily
            scalp should avoid hair oil. Our scalps have a natural reservoir of oil for hair
            strands every time the scalp goes too dry. This is Sebum that keeps your hair moisturized.
            On the contrary, hair loses its natural sheen if you keep massaging oil every night
            on your head vigorously. This can damage your hair in two ways: Make hair strands
            more brittle and make it more dry the minute you shampoo it off, bringing you back
            into the same vicious circle.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Let us get the basics straight first! No oil can prevent dryness. So, what should
    one actually do? One cannot do without shampoos and old habits of dabbling oil in
    your hair die hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    What we need Today:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Buy a non-sulphate shampoo&lt;/strong&gt; and use it two times a week.&lt;img class="pull-right"
                style="max-height: 138px;" title="Hot Towel" alt="Hot Towel Rockying " src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/Hot_Towel.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Conditioning &lt;/strong&gt;your hair is the trick. Deep condition your hair thrice a week
            and wrap a &lt;strong&gt;hot towel&lt;/strong&gt; around your head for 30—40 minutes. Rinse with cold
            water and see the smoothness seep into your hair texture in no time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Conditioning also prevents split ends and hair breakage and adds bounce to hair
            texture. No oil would do that! Opt for the ones that have &lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Natural Substitutes for Hair Oil:
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Curd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fenugreek&lt;/strong&gt; (methi) hair masque&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img title="Curd" alt="Curd" src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/curd.jpg"
        height="170" width="227"&gt;&lt;img style="width: 200px;" title="Fenugreek Seeds" alt="Fenugreek Seeds"
            src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/Fenugreek-seeds.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Honey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Papaya&lt;/strong&gt; masque&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img title="Honey" alt="Honey" src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/honeey.jpg"
        style="max-height: 199px;" /&gt;&lt;img title="Papaya" alt="Papaya" src="//rockying.com/art/Hair%20Oil/papaya.jpg"
            style="max-height: 199px;" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Hair oil forms a layer on your scalp that does not promote the moisture intake of
    the skin naturally. This chokes the pores leading to formation of flakes and dandruff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    So, the next time your mom screams at you for not oiling your hair, you need to
    tell her about the new hair revolution!&lt;/h5&gt;</Text>
