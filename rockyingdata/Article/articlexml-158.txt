                One thing humans love more than themselves (Maybe!) is animals. From man's best
                friend to maybe a living nightmare; animals have influenced human life in many ways.
                So it is obvious that they form an integral part of some of the biggest on screen
                movies. Here's highlighting some of the movies that run on the animal human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;
                &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBJD-lxh078" target="_blank"&gt;101 DALMATIANS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Animal-Movies/101-Dalmatians.jpg"
                title="101 Dalmatians" alt="" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Probably the most popular movie to have us all fall in love with dogs - or Dalmatians
                in specific. Glenn Close as Cruell DeVille, a designer who is obsessed with designing
                fur coats out of real Dalmatians is extremely villainous. The highlight of the story
                is the escape of the 101 dalmatians from the evil estate called the De Vil Mansion.
                The sequel, 102 Dalmatians was just as adorable!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;
                &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UMMGNxg1Lg" target="_blank"&gt;MARLEY AND ME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Animal-Movies/marley-and-me-2.jpg"
                title="Marley And Me" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                    Based on the memoir of the same name by John Grogan, Marley and Me transcends the
                    life of a couple and their dog and vice versa. It covers the story of the titular
                    dog Marley as he is adopted by a newly expectant couple, played by Owen Wilson and
                    Jennifer Aniston. They name him Marley as a tribute to Bob Marley. And as man’s
                    best friend, Marley stands by everything - depression, Jenny’s miscarriage, children
                    and moving to a new house.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;
                &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOX1jaUEVRE" target="_blank"&gt;MIGHTY JOE YOUNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Animal-Movies/Mighty-Joe-Young.jpg"
                title="Mighty Joe Young" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                    A woman's struggle to save her gorillas from the poachers. Charlize Theron plays
                    Jill, a woman who has witnessed the death of her mother and that of her gorilla,
                    Joe's Mother. He is bought to America for safety reasons; but he escapes and creates
                    havoc in Hollywood. The story then traces his survival through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;

                &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozMmf9Yi7TM" target="_blank"&gt;DR. DOLITTLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

                    A doctor who understand what animals are saying and the animals find out. A complete
                    laugh riot with the amazingly hilarious Eddie Murphy as Dr. Dolittle who can not
                    only talk to them but used the power to treat animals better.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="text-align: center;"&gt;

                title="Stuart Little" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                    The Little family adopts an adorably naughty but extremely charming young mouse
                    and name him Stuart. But will Stuart be able to gain the love and affection as the
                    first pet of the house is a cat! Gradually, with loads of misadventures, Stuart
                    and Snowbell, the cat make amends as to the best of family intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
