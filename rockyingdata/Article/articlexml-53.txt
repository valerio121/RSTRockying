    the Oscar just round the corner, I can’t stop gushing about everything Oscar. Yes,
    that’s right, I am Oscar crazy just like most of the almost-40-million-viewers who
    viewed it last year. The 84th Academy Awards will be telecast on February 26 and
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    This year &lt;strong&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/strong&gt; has been nominated for her portrayal of
    &lt;i&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/i&gt; in “&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Iron Lady&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;”. Though Streep’s
    performance is always better than what we thought best was; there have been some
    other noteworthy performances depicting real life female heroes that made it all
    the way to Oscar glory. Here’s our take on some of the best in the recent past:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    SANDRA BULLOCK : &lt;i&gt;LEIGH ANNETUOHY&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/oscar_sandra-bullock.jpg" title="Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for her role in The Blind Side "
        alt="Sandra Bullock " style="width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Sandra_Blind%20Side.jpg" title="Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side"
        alt="" style="width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Although the movie “&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
            Blind Side&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;” &lt;strong&gt;(2009)&lt;/strong&gt; was semi biographical;
    Sandra Bullock had every woman reminded of what a hero she is capable of becoming.
    Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy who adopted Michael Oher, an offensive linesman who
    plays for the NFL. She pulls him out of his poor upbringing and gives him just what
    he deserves. A performance that delivers punch, power and just goes on to prove
    why mom’s are just the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    HELEN MIRREN : &lt;i&gt;THE QUEEN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/helen-mirren-oscars-2007-06.jpg"
        title="Helen Mirren won the Oscar for her role in The Queen" alt="Helen Mirren "
        style="width: 200px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/thequeen-743746.jpg" title="Helen's Portrayal of The Queen"
        alt="" style="width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Though people may have varied
    opinions of the British monarchy, Helen Mirren just showed how to play &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The
        Queen"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;) the royal way! As Queen Elizabeth
    the Second, Helen brought such intense drama to the portrayal of events following
    the death of Princess Diana. Though the plot is fictional, Helen Mirren made an
    Oscar worthy performance for a movie that was highly surrounded by controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    REESE WITHERSPOON : &lt;i&gt;JUNE CARTER CASH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img class="pull-left" style="width: 250px;" src="//rockying.com/art/reese-witherspoon-walk-the-line.jpg"
        title="Reese in Walk The Line" alt="" /&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/reese_witherspoon_and_oscar.jpg"
            title="Reese won the Oscar for her performance in June Carter Cash" alt="Reese Witherspoon"
            style="width: 206px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;Reese Witherspoon portrayed &lt;i&gt;June Carter
                Cash&lt;/i&gt; in “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walk the Line&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”, a &lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;
    biopic of Johnny Cash. As June, Reese Witherspoon performed the vocals, and showing
    us why we loved June Carter for the strong, determined and the no-nonsense woman
    she actually was. In a movie dedicated to Joaquin Phoenix (playing Johnny Cash),
    Reese Witherspoon manages to carve out her stand and yes, she did walk away with
    the Oscar that year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    JULIA ROBERTS : &lt;i&gt;ERIN BROCKOVICH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Julia_oscar_Erin_Brokovich.jpg" title="Julia won the Oscar for Erin Brokowich"
        alt="Julia Roberts " style="width: 250px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Erin%20Brokowich.jpg"
            title="Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich" alt="" style="width: 200px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;As
    the spunky and straight forward, in your face &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Erin Brockovich" (2000)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
    Julia Roberts actually proved why she and Erin are both made of steel! Julia Roberts
    played the woman, who fought against a giant energy corporation and actually won
    the case, the Oscar, the Golden Globe , the BAFTA and the Screen Actor’s Guild Award
    for Best Actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    SUSAN SARANDON : &lt;i&gt;HELEN PREJEAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Oscar_sarandon.jpg" title="Susan won the Oscar for her performance in Dead Man Walking "
        alt="" style="width: 200px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/susan_sarandon_.jpg" title="Susan in Dead Man Walking"
        alt="" style="width: 300px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Playing the Sister who forms
    a special bond with a man awaiting a lethal execution for six years, Susan Sarandon
    showed what acceptance, forgiveness and redemption are truly capable of. &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
        Helen Prejean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; has become the leading advocate for the abolition
    of death penalty and this movie is a testament of her determination. Susan Sarandon
    won the Oscar trophy for "&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Man Walking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;" in &lt;strong&gt;1995&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Real life still remains an inspiration for the reel life and these women, both real
    and reel, have shown us why stories are real and what it takes to mark yourself
    in history.
