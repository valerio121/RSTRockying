  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    So, here we are as promised in &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/63"&gt;Hollywood's favorite
        Movie quotes-I&lt;/a&gt; ,with the next batch of Hollywood’s best said dialogues .
    What is special about them you would say? Well, many things- the context, the amazing
    delivery, the power behind them and for the fact that they fail to leave our movie
    addicted memories! So, here’s some more of the delicious dialogues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;I’ll be back&lt;/i&gt;" (Terminator, 1984)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/ill%20be%20back.jpg"
            title="Arnold in Terminator" alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Terminator is remembered for many things but the primary reason remains this – Arnold
            Schwarzenegger. This dialogue happens when Arnold’s character is refused entry to
            the police station. Soon after, he cheekily returns in the police car, smashing
            it through the door and proceeds to destroy everything in the building. Very terminator
            indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;A martini. Shaken, not stirred&lt;/i&gt; (Goldfinger, 1964)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/james%20bond.jpg" title="Sean Connery in Goldfinger"
            alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Sean Connery remains the favorite Bond and his phrases deserve the same honor.Though
            first spoken as “Shaken and not stirred” in Dr. No; the phrase “Shaken, not stirred”
            figured first in Goldfinger. Since then, it is featured prominently in Bond movies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary&lt;/i&gt; (Dead Poet’s
            Society, 1989)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/carpe%20diem.jpg" title="Robin Williams In Dead Poet"
            alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Carpe Diem is a Latin phrase that means to pick or to gather but has extensively
            been used to translate as “to seize”. Robin Williams amazing acting skills just
            went to best in the movie and this dialogue caught every movie goers attention and
            made the movie extraordinary!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;"I’m the King of the World"&lt;/i&gt; (Titanic, 1997)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/im%20the%20king%20of%20the%20world.jpg"
            title="Di Caprio In Titanic" alt="" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Besides everything the movie is remembered for, this dialogue captures the true
            essence of the character played flawlessly by Di Caprio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;"Well, nobody's perfect"&lt;/i&gt; (Some like it hot, 1959)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/some%20like%20it%20hot.jpg"
            title="J. E. Brown in some Like It Hot" alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The dialogue which made every one stand up and take notice that after all, we are
            allowed to make mistakes. No one could have done it better than actor – comedian
            J.E. Brown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;We rob banks&lt;/i&gt;" (Bonnie and Clyde, 1967)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/bonnie%20and%20clyde.jpg"
            title="Bonnie and Clyde 1967" alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The movie was considered landmark for “breaking many cinematic taboos” but this
            dialogues personifies the eternal theme of the crime film.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you
                any stinking badges&lt;/i&gt;!" (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/badges.jpg" title="The Treasure of the Sierra 1948"
            alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Though the quote is actually a misquote, It is based on a line of dialog from a
            1927 novel but continuously appears in movies, parody and prominently in the live
            song recorded in 1985 called “Badges”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;May the Force be with you&lt;/i&gt;" (Star Wars, 1977)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/may%20the%20force%20be%20with%20you.jpg"
            title="Star Wars" alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            You can’t be a movie fan and not have watched Star Wars; further, you can’t be a
            Star Wars fan and not know what The Force is! It has become a legacy in the Star
            Wars movies and is spoken by at least one character in each movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;E.T. phone home&lt;/i&gt;" (E.T The extra terrestrial, 1982)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/e.t.jpg" title="E.T The Extra Terrestrial 1982"
            alt="" style="width: 223px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The E.T Craze still lingers and the dialogue to phone home just got bigger than
            the extra terrestrial itself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;You talkin to me&lt;/i&gt;" (Taxi Driver, 1976)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/you%20talkin%20to%20me.jpg"
            title="Robert Di Niro in Taxi Driver 1976" alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This dialogue delivered by Robert Di Niro became the pop culture and has since then,
            prominently featured in a number of movies and television series. It was chosen
            as number 10 on American Film Institute’s top 100 best movie quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            “&lt;i&gt;But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving
                forward&lt;/i&gt;”. (Rocky Balboa, 2006)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/Hollywood%20dialogues%202/rockybalboa.jpg" title="Rocky Balboa 2006"
            alt="" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            And last but not the least, the editor’s choice, When senior Rocky says this to
            Junior Rocky; little did he know that it would become the theme for all speakers
            and motivational coaches around the world. It became a theme and Rocky and everyone
            of learnt to get up and fight back!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
