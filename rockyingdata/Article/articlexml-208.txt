            AVIATORS : Fly in Style!&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/Sun-Glasses/Shahrukh-Tom-Aviators.jpg"
            style="max-width: 95%;" alt="Shahrukh Khan in Aviators glasses" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Originally created by Bausch and Lomb and branded by Ray Ban in 1936, aviators were
            created for pilots to protect their eyes while flying - thus getting their name.
            The glasses are usually tear drop shaped encased by a thin metal frame and the design
            is such that it covers the entire eye preventing light from any angle to enter.
            The aviators were popularised by the Beatles, in the movie &lt;strong&gt;Top Gun&lt;/strong&gt;
            and later on by politicians too! The Aviator tops the list and remains a classic
            favorite. Locally, &lt;strong&gt;Shah Rukh Khan&lt;/strong&gt; is regularly seen in aviators
            and heartthrob Salman Khan popularized it in his hit movie Dabangg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
            WAYFARER : Geeky!&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/Sun-Glasses/Wayfarers-Collage.jpg"
            style="max-width: 95%;" alt="Wayfarer glasses" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Wayfarers were credited with the bringing of plastic revolution in the sunglass
            industry in 1952. Getting away from the metal frame of the Aviators, Wayfarers were
            extremely popular when launched. However it went on to see a steady decline in its
            sale but there were periods of revival and since 2000’s Wayfarer has become extremely
            popular thanks to celebrities. Fans of the sunglass include Johnny Depp Michael
            Jackson, Madonna, Anna Wintour, Billy Joel. The latest sensations to wear it were
            Twilight character Edward Cullen and Katy Perry in her hit video Teenage Dreams.
            In India, Saif Ali Khan sported the eyewear in his recent Agent Vinod.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            The favorite of many leading ladies; the cat eye glasses are, as the name suggests,
            meant to give you the cat like look. Usually oversized, coming in various colors,
            cat eye give you the extra glam look. Many Indian leading ladies have been spotted
            in this eye wear; the biggest fan probably being Bipasha Basu.

        &lt;p&gt;
            The wrap frames that is known to stick to your face from all sides became popular
            after Will Smith sported it in Men In Black. The glasses are another product of the
            Ray Ban company and are best suited for those who don’t prefer to go with oversizing
            of frames.

            for regular use too. Many celebrities have endorsed their brand and these sunglasses
            are uber smart for hiking, adventure or any sporty activity done in the sun. Most
            cricketers, (of late the stylish Virat Kohli) have usually been spotted in Oakley
            glasses on field. &lt;a href="//www.rockying.com/a/170"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; wore a variety called the Oakley Romeo in 
                Mission Impossible II

            You can’t do a sunglass article without mentioning James Bond. Wearing the Tom Ford
            sunglasses in Quantum of Solace, Daniel Craig popularised the Tom Ford Sunglasses.
            Named after famous fashion designer and film director, Tom Ford, these remain highly
            expensive but could be found on a few online shops. These glasses are made of a
            semi matte rhodium frame. Check the &lt;a href="http://www.tomford.com/" target="_blank"&gt;
                Tom Ford&lt;/a&gt; website for details and come back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Though there are so many to name and to discover, sunglasses still continue to be
    designed in various styles. Whatever, you choose to wear, just remember to screen
    your eyes from the harshly terrible sun rays.
