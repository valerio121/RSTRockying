    As the mercury soars this summer, &lt;a href="//www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
    presents some easy-to-prepare thirst quenchers and ways to beat the heat. We get
    totally exclusive for our readers with some special tips to become that Ice, Ice
    Baby in this hot weather!&lt;br&gt;
    Summers can remind one of summer vacations, snow-capped peaks and may be tonnes
    of unpleasant holiday homework from school. With all of this piling on our heads,
    health can reasonably take a toll. The next logical step? Say goodbye to teas and
    coffees. Let not the weather dampen your spirits!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    PERFECT SUMMER DRINKS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; COCONUT WATER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Cool-Drinks/Coconut.jpg" title="Coconut Water"
    alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No doubt a bottle of Pepsi is far cheaper than coconut water. But a perfect summer
drink is something that makes you feel less acidic and quenches your thirst at the
same time. Let coconut water be your tonic this season and save your intestines
from some hot-food hell fire!&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CHAANCH WITH MINT&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Cool-Drinks/Chaach-with-mint.jpg"
        title="Chaach with Mint" alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Now spice up that unexciting chaanch of yours by adding crushed mint leaves (a handful
    of these would do) and add it before pouring in chaanch. Do not stir the magic potion
    and refrigerate it for an hour or so. Pour some crushed ice from top and just sip
    your way to Nirvana!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; GREEN ORB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Cool-Drinks/DSCN5768.jpg" title="Green Orb"
        alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    You would require curd, a few mint leaves, cumin (zeera) seeds a pinch of black
    salt and coriander leaves. Hotelier industry biggies such as Hilton enlist this
    in their carte du jour. So why not try this at home? Roast cumin seeds and crush
    it along with mint leaves in that kitchen okhli (mortar) you have left unused for
    long and mix it with the rest of the ingredients. Add plain water or soda water
    and refrigerate it for half hour. Now rim the glass with salt and a slice of lemon
    and serve this green orb. Are you set to change your destiny this summer? Cheers
    to good health!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DON'T FEAR SHAKESPEARE (The Ginger-Lemongrass Drink) !!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Cool-Drinks/Ginger-Lemongrass-Drink.jpg"
            title="Ginger-Lemongrass Drink" alt="" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Well with all that logic Shakespeare was out to set through his plays, this drink
    has a similar temperament to change what is long been studied or consumed! Change
    history, change your gastronomical pattern with this drink. What more? It is not
    as complicated as Shakespeare, blahaha!!! Take a slice of ginger, a few strands
    of lemon grass and soda. Crush ginger and lemon grass and boil it for 15 minutes.
    Let it cool and add soda to it. Grate some unpeeled lemon from top and crushed ice.
    Sweeten it as you like and aaaah! Beat the heat.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETS:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Packed lassis, Coco berry stores, ice cream parlors, iced teas, lemon drinks, soda
    water and other coolers and mocktails that eating joints have can be that perfect
    replacement for hot teas. Also...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;STAY COOL AND SWEAT FREE WITH THE FOLLOWING TIPS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take bath at least twice a day and avoid using excess of deodorants and roll-ons.
        They do not do any good to the skin (it can lead to cysts in armpits) or save you
        from a sweaty day. Summers do make us sweat like pigs and deos wonâ€™t make it any
        better!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid onion and garlic consumption to get rid of that stinky underarm.
            These foods warm the body up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include pudina (mint) leaves (whole or crushed)
                in your diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have fruits that have water-content in it. Water melons, kiwis,
                    cantaloupes, yellow melons, passion fruits, apricots to name a few can keep you
                    sinfully cool this summer.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Make best use of the weather and eat healthy to stay fit. Embrace the season with
    a smile. Cheers!&lt;/h5&gt;</Text>
