    who unfolds her South African Safari and why she finds it her most favorite travel
    destination...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRAVELER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a target="_blank" title="Marie Loerzel" href="http://rockthekasbahafrica.blogspot.com"&gt;
        Marie Loerzel&lt;/a&gt;, an American, currently living in Morocco with her husband
    and four children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    PLACE SHE LOVED&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Living in Northern Africa they do a lot of travel within &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco"&gt;
        Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. There is a ferry that runs between Morocco and Spain. But, even
    flights from here into the European highlights like Paris and London are cheap.
    And there are lots of discount airlines popping up. It's more difficult to travel
    between African countries, even though they live here. Flights within the continent
    are quite expensive and depending on where you are traveling, some less tourist
    laden countries will only have flights in and out once a week and they will usually
    involve an out of the way connection in Europe or Dubai. “We have traveled to two
    African countries while we've lived here. The first is Egypt and we went the month
    after the revolution, not by design mind you, but our favorite by far was a safari
    we took which started in &lt;a target="_blank" title="South Africa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;South Africa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, she exults. “We wanted to go on a safari while in
    Africa and we had heard how beautiful South Africa was. The safari was also cheaper
    than a lot of other destinations like Tanzania or Kenya” advised Marie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    WHY MARIE LOVED SOUTH AFRICA&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/South%20Africa/cradle_of_human_kind.jpg"
        title="The Cradle Of Human Kind" alt="" style="height: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    South Africa lives up to its reputation. It is absolutely gorgeous. Marie and family
    stayed in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; for
    few days before their safari began. They'd heard horror stories of how unsafe and
    crime ridden Jo'burg was but to discover the truth, it was not found any less safe
    than any other big city. Plus, the grocery stores had more of selection than in
    Morocco and the language is English, which makes it really easy to get around. The
    &lt;b&gt;cradle of human kind&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Blyde River Canyon&lt;/b&gt; which is the largest green
    canyon in the world, are those must visits. Of course game driving in &lt;b&gt;Kruger National
        Park&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/South%20Africa/Kruger_national%20Park.jpg"
        title="Kruger National Park" alt="" style="height: 246px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;where
    you get to see elephants, giraffes, rhinos, moneys, warthogs and camping out in
    tents underneath the stars will be your memories to cherish for a lifetime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    BEST TIME TO BE THERE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    December over Christmas is just perfect because in the Northern Hemisphere it's winter, but in the Southern Hemisphere, it's summer. So Marie and company got to
    escape the dreary rainy cold Moroccan winter and get some sunshine. Bonus for the
    traveler, that South Africa is a Christian country that celebrates Christmas, which
    doesn't happen in Muslim Morocco. Summer is supposed to be the rainy season, but
    they didn't experience it until they drove up through
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/South%20Africa/Botawana_Safari.jpg"
        title="Botswana Safari" alt="" style="height: 197px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Botswana&lt;/b&gt;
    later in the trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    MONEY MATTERS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Airfare is expensive and there's no way around that. But once you're in-country
    it's not as expensive as say London or Switzerland. But, it's definitely worth the trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    WHY SHE RECOMMENDS SOUTH AFRICA&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We would definitely recommend going to South Africa despite the cost to get there.
    We had memories to last a lifetime in one of the most beautiful places we've ever been. Seeing elephants and giraffes and zebras never gets old or less exciting.
