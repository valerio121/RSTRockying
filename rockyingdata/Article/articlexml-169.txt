  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    Who doesn’t love eating? Probably many of us would nod their head vigorously and
    I agree with the term “I live to eat”. But then too much food is a trouble, but
    shockingly too less food is also a trouble. Some people actually have trouble eating;
    yes, just putting food into their mouth, or even worse, feeling guilt after having
    eaten food. Confused? Well, we at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
    share a little more insight into what is commonly known as “&lt;b&gt;Eating Disorder&lt;/b&gt;”.
    Have a look at the video here:
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    WHAT IS AN EATING DISORDER?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Eating disorder refers to a group of conditions which might involve either too much
    eating or excessively low intake of food to the point that it is detrimental to
    the person’s physical, emotional and mental well being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There are over eleven types of eating disorders but the most common forms are &lt;b&gt;Anorexia
        Nervosa&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Bulimia Nervosa&lt;/b&gt;. And here’s a little bit of each of them
    and what they really mean.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Anorexia Nervosa&lt;/b&gt; is a refusal on the person's behalf to maintain the right
    body weight. The person always imagines themselves to be heavier and much more fatter
    than they actually are. There is a constant and extreme fear of gaining weight and
    to soothe this fear, extremely unhealthy eating habits are formed; despite being
    highly underweight.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There might be a constant refusal to eat, or eating might take in extremely limited
    and tiny portions. So much so that it has extreme detrimental effects on the body
    such as loss of body hair, extreme hair fall, loss of skin integrity and the body
    becomes susceptible to heart related problems. The risk of death is extremely high
    in such cases.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A famous example of this is&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09ckX-Mmdwo"&gt; Karen
        Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;, a musician (singer and drummer), who went on a water diet to
    lose weight and “appear attractive” but then the extreme weight loss caused severe
    complications and lead to heart failure which resulted in her death at 32 years
    of age.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Bulimia Nervosa&lt;/b&gt; is a disorder wherein the person indulges in binge eating-
    eating too much- and then is overcome by extreme guilt and indulges in activities
    to “shed off” the weight put on due to the binging. This might include excessive
    exercise, self induced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives to wash away what was
    taken in.

        title="Princess Diana" alt="" style="float: right;" height="222" width="282"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Dancer, singer and reality show (American Idol) judge &lt;a href="http://www.your-bulimia-recovery.com/paula-abdul-bulimia.html"&gt;
        Paula Abdul&lt;/a&gt; has opened talk about her battle against bulimia. She is the
    spokesperson for &lt;a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/"&gt;National Eating Disorders
        Association&lt;/a&gt; and usually describes her struggle with the disorder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The late &lt;a href="http://www.dianaforever.com/bulimia.htm"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Princess Diana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    struggled with eating disorder Bulimia and admitted that she used to self-harm herself.
    Diana also admitted in a television interview that she intentionally cut her arms
    and legs and had thrown herself down a flight of stairs on more than one occasion.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Other celebrities from the Hollywood scene, involved and highly disturbed by this
    disorder include &lt;b&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Elton John&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Jessica Alba&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Jane Fonda&lt;/b&gt;
    are some names to mention in regard to this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Eating-Disorders/Anushka-Anorexia.jpg"
        title="Anushka Sharma" alt="" style="width: 400px; float: left;"&gt;At home, Bollywood
    leading ladies &lt;b&gt;Kareena Kapoor&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kangana Ranaut&lt;/b&gt; and more recently &lt;b&gt;Anushka
        Sharma&lt;/b&gt; have been targeted to have been suffering from eating disorders;
    but then none of them have openly confessed to it.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    The underlying factors, causes are very complex but yes, one does need to go out
    and seek help when body images and perceptions about one’s body is totally different.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Find out what is healthy and stick to it, indulge in it. You are the change your
    body sees!
