            Rakshabandhan Special&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Rakshabandhan just went by recently. We at &lt;a href="//www.facebook.com/rockyingmag"&gt;
                Rockying&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t help but notice how Bollywood manages to tug the heart
            when it comes to portraying brothers in Indian cinema. Siblings will fight, will
            argue but at the end of the day, their love for each other prevails. Known for their
            protectiveness towards their siblings, their ability to be a toughie outside and
            a softie at heart and their ability to make sure that their siblings have the best
            of everything; brothers have always played a significant role in the desi world
            of cinema.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            So, here’s looking at some of the best Bhaiyya’s of Bollywood and how they managed
            to make an impact within our hearts!&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;

                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        SATTE PE SATTA (1982)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Movie with the biggest brother count! Seven brothers living cordially under one roof.
                        It reaches out to the story of their adjusting to a woman in the house when their
                        eldest brother gets married, falling in love and helping each other out. But the
                        biggest triumph is when they get together to bring their kidnapped brother back
                        safely. A laugh riot that manages to be just as heart warming.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/Om-Jai-Jagdish.jpg"
                        alt="Om Jai Jagdish" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        OM JAI JAGDISH (2002)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        This one comes with the sensitivity one can expect from Bollywood. Starting with
                        how three brothers live a happy life under one roof and how they slowly get divided
                        on opinions because of a new comer to the house. The family breaks apart but the
                        brothers can’t seem to forget the bond they shared. Then follows a struggle to salvage
                        their family home and to prove that the bond between brothers can never be torn
                        apart!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/Hum-Saath-Saath-Hain-Still.jpg"
                        alt="Hum Saath Saath Hain" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        HUM SAATH SAATH HAIN (1999)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        The bond between step brothers in this movie just shows that it doesn't matter where
                        you come from, once you are a brother, it overcomes all barriers. Monish Behl playing
                        the eldest brother to his younger brothers portrayed by Salman and Saif and a sister
                        played by Neelam. When Neelam’s relationship with her brother in law is strained,
                        the brothers help her set up her new home. Also, a misunderstanding that breaks
                        the family apart doesn’t manage to make the brothers stay apart.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/my-brother-nikhil.jpg"
                        alt="My Brother Nikhil" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        My Brother Nikhil (2005)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        The most touching movie of its time. Juhi Chawla plays the elder sister to famous
                        swimmer and younger brother Sanjay Suri. Once the younger brother is diagnosed with
                        being HIV + he is shunned by everyone - his swimming team, his friends, his parents.
                        The only person standing by him is his sister Anamika (Juhi Chawla). This one manages
                        to make you stand up and take notice and it scores extra points for the portrayal
                        of the beautiful relationship between the siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/naam-Duo.jpg"
                        alt="Naam" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        NAAM (1986)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Two brothers are cheated on the false pretext of a job abroad. However, one of them
                        gets trapped into working for a fraudulent smuggler. The song “Tu Kal Chala Jayega..”
                        is an epic sketch of what binds siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;

                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        PYAAR KIYA TO DARNA KYA (1998)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        When siblings lose their parents, the brother portrayed by Arbaaz dons the fatherly
                        figure role and become his sister's guardian. The sister however, falls in love
                        with a hunk from college. What follows is a laugh riot by the hero to convince and
                        impress the brother that he is going to be good enough for his sister. But, it is
                        hard pleasing that brother - especially given the fact that the brother will go
                        any length to protect his sister’s good will!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/amar-akbar-anthony.jpg"

                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        AMAR AKBAR ANTHONY (1977)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Three brothers separated at birth and separated by religion. However, once they
                        come together, they overcome all these barriers to get back together and put the
                        villain behind bars. A hilarious yet heart wrenching movie that manages to have
                        the teardrops rolling!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/deewar-1975.jpg"
                        alt="Deewar Movie 1975" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        DEEWAAR (1975)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        A tragic story of two brothers growing up in impoverished conditions yet going in
                        opposite directions. One becomes an honest police inspector (Shashi Kapoor) and
                        the other  (Amitabh Bachchan) turns to crime. Shashi tries convincing his brother,
                        even arguing it out as he hopes to mend ways and bring Amitabh to justice. However,
                        there is no turning back from the bad world of the underworld and this leads to
                        a tragic end. However, the intensity and dramatic scenes between the two brothers
                        is worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/mere-brother-ki-dulhan.jpg"
                        alt="Mere Brother Ki Dulhan" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN (2011)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        This began with confusion; falling in love with your brother’s fiance! But then,
                        the younger brother takes on the role of being more mature in making his elder brother
                        find his true love and also his own. A good watch to understand the fun camaraderie
                        shared by the on screen brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/hare-rama-hare-krishna.jpg"
                        alt="Hare Rama Hare Krishna" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        HARE RAMA HARE KRISHNA (1971)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Probably the first movie that brings out the brother - sister bound beautifully.
                        Dev Anand plays the big brother who is separated from his younger sister (played
                        by Zeenat Aman) as a result of broken marriage. Years later, he ventures out to
                        bring his sister back, only to find out that he has to fight the drug induced world
                        of his younger wrongly westernized sister to save her. A beautiful movie that manages
                        to tug your heartstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//www.rockying.com/art/Bollywood-Brother-Sister/Jane-tu-ya-jane-na.jpg"
                        alt="Jaane Tu Ya Jane Na" style="max-width: 600px" /&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;h4&gt;
                        JAANE TU..YA JAANE NA (2008)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Though the movie is remembered for the debut of Imran Khan; one thing that most
                        people missed is the brother and sister bond shared between characters played by
                        Genelia D’souza and Prateik Babbar. Like any brother, Babbar hates his sisters love
                        interest because he feels his sister being “stolen away”. Playing the younger,
                        insecure brother role by aplomb, Babbar managed to win hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slide"&gt;

                        JOSH (2000)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Two of Bollywood’s biggest actors - Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai played the
                        adorable fraternal twins in this 2000 superhit movie. Shah Rukh played the protective
                        big brother role who is watchful of his younger sister’s every move. He interferes
                        with her love, gets bossy but it is all acceptable as he does it thinking about
                        the “best interest” for his sister. Not before, he gets a taste of his own medicine
                        when he falls in love! Set in Goa, the film casts an unusual impression of the actors (as siblings). &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
