  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    There is nothing more interesting in movies than what the actors have to say and
    how they say it. The dialogues bring out the essence of the characters and make
    the story powerful and narration possible. Here’s our take on the some of the most
    powerful and entertaining dialogues that just seem to be etched in memories long
    after the movies end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn&lt;/i&gt; (Gone with the Wind, 1939)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/gone%20with%20the%20wind.jpg"
                title="Gone With The Wind" alt="" style="width: 250px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;Probably,
            the most powerful dialogue of all times that just doesn’t seem to let go from our
            memory. Spoken by Clark Gable as his last words to Scarlett O’Hara; it not only
            contained profanity, which was relatively new to the Hollywood movie industry, but
            it also marks the end of their relationship, referring to how he doesn’t care what
            happens to her hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Bond, James Bond&lt;/i&gt;" (Dr. No, 1962)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/bond%20-%20dr.no.jpg"
                title="James Bond" alt="" style="width: 296px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            First said in the Bond movie Dr. No; this continues to be a favorite among all Bond
            fans alike. Said by Sean Connery, this introduction became the catch phrase and
            would soon be continued to feature in almost every Bond flick. In 2005, it was honored
            as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinematic history by the American Film Institute.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna
                get.&lt;/i&gt;" (Forrest Gump, 1994)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/forrest%20gump%20and%20the%20box%20of%20chocolates.jpg"
                title="Forrest Gump" alt="" style="height: 250px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;The movie
            which will always be remembered for its many powerful dialogues and the amazingly
            superb performance of Tom Hanks; Forrest Gump maintains to be a cinematic favorite.
            Said by Tom Hanks in reference to what his beloved mother on screen, Sally Fields
            says, the phrase epitomized Forrest’s belief in making the best of all things around.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;I am going to make him an offer he can’t refuse&lt;/i&gt;" (The Godfather, 1972)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/godfather.jpg" title="God Father"
                alt="" style="width: 250px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            Don Vito Corleone's line "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" was voted
            as the second most memorable line in cinema history in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie
            Quotes by the American Film Institute.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Go ahead, make my day&lt;/i&gt;" (Sudden Impact , 1983)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/sudden%20imapct%20-%20clint%20eastwood.jpg"
                title="Sudden Impact" alt="" style="width: 250px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;The phrase
            "go ahead make my day" was written by Charles B. Pierce an independent film maker
            who wrote the screen play Sudden Impact as a project for himself. One day Eastwood
            asked Pierce what he was working on and if he could read it, which is how Sudden
            Impact became a Dirty Harry film. As legend goes, the actual origins of the phrase
            came from Pierce's father who used to tell him as a child, "son, you just let me
            come home again today without that lawn being mowed, just go ahead make my day".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Show me the Money&lt;/i&gt;" (Jerry Maguire, 1996)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/cuba%20gooding%20jr%20-%20show%20me%20the%20money.jpg"
                title="Jerry Maguire" alt="" style="width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            When Cuba Gooding Jr. screamed Show me the Money little did he know that it would
            be the role that would drive him to Oscar glory! But it did and it lead to the best
            Oscar acceptance speech of all times too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;datasource name="boxaddatasource" /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;"I see dead people"&lt;/i&gt; (The Sixth Sense, 1999)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/i%20see%20dead%20people.jpg"
                title="The Sixth Sense" alt="" style="width: 250px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;When
            little Harry Joel Osment utters his terrible confession, not only does it initiate
            a sense of horror in the audience but it brings about a bout of empathy for the
            child who is actually seeing dead people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Love means never having to say you’re sorry&lt;/i&gt;" (Love Story, 1970)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/love-story_l.jpeg" title="Love Story 1970"
                alt="" style="height: 250px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;Probably one of the best
            love dialogues that still remains a favorite among the romantics. Based on the best
            selling Eric Segal novel, the movie had the dialogue twice - once when Jennifer
            says it and the other time as the last line of the film when Oliver Barrett IV says
            it as a tribute to Jennifer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Hasta la vista, baby"&lt;/i&gt; (Terminator 2 : Judgment Day, 1991)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/terminator.jpg" title="Terminator"
                alt="" width="200" class="pull-left" /&gt;
            Basically a Spanish farewell, that means something on the lines of See you Later;
            the phrase caught on. The term was used in the popular hit song in 1987 and finds
            it usage in much more places. Schwarzenegger has famously used the phrase during
            his speeches since being a part of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h5&gt;
            "&lt;i&gt;Hello, Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt;" (Funny Girl, 1968)&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            Barbara Streisand said the famous words not only in
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Dialogues-1/babra%20streisand%20receiving%20oscar%20for%20funny%20firl.jpg"
                title="Babra streisand receiving oscar for funny Girl" alt="" style="width: 250px;"
                class="pull-right" /&gt;the movie, but it also was her first comment after receiving
            the Oscar statuette for Best Actress. It has since then been used in many movies
            and was voted as number 81 on American Film’s Institute Best 100 movie dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, here’s our first take on the best Hollywood movie dialogues; though there are
    so many more to add, we just can’t go on and on. So, stay on because we do come
