&lt;p&gt;
Vietnam is full of hiking getaways that will bring you peace of mind. Majestic
highland valleys, terraced rice paddies, dramatic mountain paths and remarkable underneath
towering limestone mountain ranges are the common landscapes in the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More importantly, hiking in the country is a great way to spend some time alone and luxuriate
the invaluable treasures of nature. The picturesque hiking spectrum of Vietnam will surely
get you away from all the stresses you endured on a daily basis.
&lt;p&gt;
Here is a bucket list of excellent hiking getaways in Vietnam from the less strenuous walks on
trails to the most spectacular landscapes, which is exciting for everyone regardless of your hiking
experience or physical fitness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Sapa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sapa is commonly known as the home of the dense network of trails and one of the famous
hiking destinations in Vietnam. There is no individual trail that stands out from the rest since
every trail is linked to one another; consequently creating a perfect trail that will match each
person’s hiking skill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The place is most famous for its terraced rice paddies and wonderful mountain villages. After
reaching the mountain village, you can witness a spectacular overview of a plunging valley with
mountains towering above on all sides that emerge on clear days, which, sometimes, is
subdued by thick mist rolling across the peaks. But, there’s nothing to be sad about it since,
although it's cloudy, the local hill-tribe people fill the town with colour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Ha Giang&lt;/h2&gt;
