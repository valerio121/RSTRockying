It is such a special feeling to see your child grow and blossom. Every day, your baby learns something new. Whether you’re an experienced parent or a first-time mom, you always watch out for baby’s development signs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Knowing the milestones can ease your mind and keep the baby’s progress under check. But please note that every baby is different and you should not compare him with others. Each baby advances at his unique pace. If you notice any red flags, it is essential to consult the pediatrician.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
