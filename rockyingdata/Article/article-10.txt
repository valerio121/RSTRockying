<p><br><img src="http://rudrasofttech.com/rockying/art/Airshow-Tricolor-2.jpg" title="Happy Republic Day India" alt="" style="float: left;">It all started with 2012 being declared as the doomsday that would have marked the end of the earth. However, Indians did manage to step on to 2012 with skepticism, faith, fun, outdated resolutions, partying and beliefs. <br>We all saw shoes being hurled at politicians, the mass getting involved in the Anna Hazare movement and celebrate the spirit of fighting against corruption, Oprah’s visit to India and the mystery around Rushdie. Some of these become the perfect news bytes that can be watched repeatedly sitting on the couch with your favourite bag of chips. The rest of the ‘Breaking News’ diligently update you on the tele-serial <b>TRPs.</b> <br>So what is so special about celebrating a <b>Republic Day</b>? We still curse, while walking on the street and imagine a better world awaiting us. Blame-game is our favorite way of passing time. Apart from that, it is our fortune that our Republic Day falls during the winter months, so the terraces become the perfect places for knitting sweaters and having oranges while we all bask in the sun. We are Indians yet the spirit remains that of a rebel. <br>We do see tricolor bandanas and other fashionable t-shirts worn by the youth who think it is good to keep one selves updated on the same. The youth has a chalta hai attitude in general but when it comes to the power of expression, we are Indians and proud. We all know what we lack but we preserve what we think we cannot lose. We all celebrate the freedom of spirit and this is exactly what this day stands for!<br>Grab your favorite movie, cozy yourself up in the blanket, call that long-lost friend of yours, do something for the poor, let the aged feel that they are wanted and loved, watch that Republic Day parade on television like you have always done – whatever we do, we are Desi at heart. After all, if given a choice, we would not want to be born in some different country! Such is the affinity, such is the patriotism. Wish you all a very<b> Happy Republic Day</b>!<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
