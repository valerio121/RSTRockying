Everybody has their own version of history, politics and social interpretation but tolerance and brotherhood unites us.<br>&nbsp;Every Indian is funnily cynical and yet they would run to kill if someone hurls abuses about their “Khandaan”. These extraordinary moments make India what it is today. <br>Before you brush up your knowledge on some of the important facts about Republic Day, here are a few funny ones:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year three people were awarded the Padma Shree award: Helen, Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai. We can all understand Helen’s achievement but Akshay and Aishwarya’s acting skills seriously do not make sense!<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is an extremely funny idea to imagine <b>Kolaveri Di </b>take over our age old patriotic songs this season. After all, according to Oprah, there is a lot of method to our madness. Kolaveri Di would be effective enough to loosen up all that firmness that you had made up during the national anthem, in a perfect way!<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can definitely think of meeting that fauji uncle of yours, if you think you are feeling a little less patriotic this time.<br></p><h3><b>Time for the 7 most Interesting Facts:</b></h3><p>1.&nbsp; Republic Day celebration actually lasts for three days!
