    The silver screen is getting wider and younger as child artists of Bollywood offer
    mind blasting performances every now and then. From Jugal Hansraj and Urmila Matondkar
    in Masoom to Darsheel Safary in Taare Zameen Par the audiences cannot get enough
    of these kiddie stars who are as good as professionals! It’s no child’s play happening
    here in Bollywood we can say. This edition of &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
    discusses the present brigade of the most darling kiddies of the Indian Film industry.
    Long Live, &lt;a href="http://www.bollymeaning.com/2011/06/chillar-party-meaning.html"&gt;
        Chillar Party&lt;/a&gt;!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;DARSHEEL SAFARY (Taare Zameen Par)&lt;/strong&gt;: His cute little bunny teeth
            and his now-grumpy-now-enlightened face is India’s favorite. He carries with himself
            the future of Bollywood. With this very first film, we saw some serious and crazy
            acting from the kid who clearly was the ruling star of the film Taare Zameen Par.
            With such ease has he delivered the character of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia"
                target="_blank"&gt;dyslexic&lt;/a&gt; child that it will not be wrong to say that Aamir’s
            presence in the film somewhat dims with the aura of this kid. Way to go Inu !&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;

                    width="400" frameborder="0" height="250"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Child-Artists/azharuddin_rubina__1350225c.jpg"
                title="Azhar &amp;amp; Rubina at the Oscars" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUBINA
                    ALI &amp;amp; AZHAR ISMAIL (SlumDog Millionaire)&lt;/strong&gt;: Fate does play a
            role in our lives and Rubina and Azhar have proven it. Straight from the slums to
            a Hollywood production, these kids walked the red carpet towards the academy awards
            at a very tender age proving to the world that they have many promises to unfold
            in the future. Whatever their lives were, we do see some rockying performances from
            these kids! Extremely naïve, rural and innocent, Rubina and Azhar display some solid
            screen presence that definitely does not go unnoticed both in Hollywood and Bollywood.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Child-Artists/Makdee-Chunni-Munni.jpg"
                title="Swetha Prasad in Makdee" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SWETHA BASU PRASAD&amp;nbsp; (Makdee/Iqbal):&lt;/strong&gt; Remember Swetha in Shabana
            Azmi’s production Makdee? The girl with the Chunni-Munni fame is simply too cute
            with her acting. Bubbly and vivacious, we were totally awed with her dialogue delivery
            in this film and Iqbal. Two off beat critically acclaimed film, this girl seems
            too sure with her choice of films so far. Rockying says that she can be a package
            full of surprises for Gen Next! Do not fall off your seat yet- this girl has already
            created a niche in Telegu film industry and is passionate about Bengali films because
            of her Bong origin. Phew!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Child-Artists/hansika%20motwani%20koi%20mil%20gaya.jpg"
                title="Hansika Motwani with Hrithik Roshan in Koi Mil Gaya" alt="" class="pull-left"
                style="max-height: 263px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HANSIKA MOTWANI (Koi Mil Gaya)&lt;/strong&gt;:
            She started off as a very cute face of television and branched out to mainstream
            Bollywood hits. Hansika’s adorable and appealing looks have matured off really well
            in her later years. For that good memory brush up, Hrithik’s film Koi… mil gaya
            features Hansika at her best while in Aap Ka Suroor, she is unimaginably a hot property.
            Well, Rockying sees that she is fast with her approach, noticeable and can give
            any actress a run for her money. Very soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Child-Artists/Swini.jpg"
                title="Swini Khara &amp;amp; Amitabh Bachchan in Cheeni Kum" alt="" style="max-width: 300px;"
                class="pull-right" /&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SWINI KHARA (Cheeni Kum)&lt;/strong&gt;: Her acting in Amitabh Bachchan starrer
            Cheeni Kum is breathtaking and unbelievable for a child actor to pull it off. An
            ailing child who knows that she will not last long to see her adulthood, Swini pulls
            the strings of comedy in the film brilliantly and at ease. It is interesting to
            see her struggle between some serious acting with dashes of cute kiddie behavior.
            Her bantering with Amitabh as a jealous little girlfriend steals our hearts, seriously!
            We wish to see more of her. Are the directors listening?Well, these kids have an
            aura around them. And they seemingly know it all- how to handle stardom, meaningful
            cinema and refined acting. As for us audiences, we suddenly have more and more entertainment
            for us in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="rstquestion"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: Green;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FUN QUIZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Swetha Basu Prasad has played a double role alongside which famous Indian actor playing the negative role, in a Vishal Bhardwaj film? &lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Pankaj Kapoor&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Vipin Sharma&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li data-anwser ="correct"&gt;Shabana Azmi&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Markand Deshpande &lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Who is your favorite movie-toddler? You sure do not want them to grow up, do you?&lt;/h5&gt;</Text>
