            &lt;p style="font-size:16px;"&gt;
                Having recently celebrated his 50th birthday, there is no doubt that Tom Cruise
                is the ever charming heartthrob that he was when he made his debut in the 80s. Known
                for his super stardom, his groovy life style, his charisma of winning millions of
                hearts across the globe or simply for his block buster movies; Tom Cruise isn't
                just an actor, he is a phenomenon. Here's looking at some of his biggest hits from
                his career that managed to keep the audiences glued to their seats!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/Top_Gun.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise In Top Gun" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Though Tom Cruise starred in a couple of movies before Top Gun in 1986. But Top
                Gun was what put him in the super stardom. An action movie highlighting the struggle
                of Lieutenant Maverick as he trains through flying school, romances the female instructor
                and overcomes his crisis after facing a near fatal accident. But like any superstar,
                he manages all fine... no surprises there!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/Born_on_the_Fourth_of_July.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise In Born On The 4th Of July" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Earning him his first Academy Award nomination, this movie went on to be one of
                the biggest commercial and critical success for the star. Playing Ron Kovic, the
                soldier who was paralyzed by the Vietnam war and then goes on to become a political
                activist because he feels neglected by his own country.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/mission-impossible.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise plays Ethan in Mission Impossible " alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Any one who had doubts about Tom Cruise, changed with this movie. Not only was this
                movie an out right blockbuster, but playing Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise just went from
                stardom to super-stardom and the spy movie went on to have become a franchise with
                the fourth installment released in 2011. MI deals with Ethan Hunt’s mission as he
                works undercover for IMF.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/Jerry-Maguire.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise In Jerry Maguire" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                1996 was Tom Cruise’s biggest year. Not only did he star and produce the blockbuster
                MI in 1996, but he went to star and play the lead role in Jerry Maguire. Playing
                a sport agent who is fired for expressing himself after suffering a nervous breakdown,
                Jerry then sticks to the only athlete who is ready to take his chances with him.
                Not only this won Tom cruise an Academy Award nomination, but the movie also went on to be
                highly popular.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/cruisemad-magnolia.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise In Magnolia" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Tom Cruise feels Magnolia is “the best movie he will ever make”. An epic mosaic
                movie about several inter-related characters in search of happiness and life's meaning.
                And this earned another Academy Award nomination in the Supporting Actor category.
                &lt;b&gt;Rockying says&lt;/b&gt;: The actor’s appearance in the film is way too different from his MI look. Actors surely are characters.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/Vanilla.Sky.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Life turns a surreal turn for a publisher after he meets with an accident caused
                by a jaded lover. Is it for real or is it a dream sequence, Vanilla Sky serves,
                with equal ease, to the mind of the romantics and the psychological thrillers.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/Minority-Report.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise In Minority Report" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Based in the futuristic world of 2054 where crime can be forecast before it actually
                occurs Minority Report is a combination of thriller and science fiction. It was
                one of the best reviewed movies of 2002 and went on to be a commercial blockbuster.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/VALKERIE.jpg"
                title="Tom Cruise in Valkyrie" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Based on the German plot of assassinating Hitler, Tom Cruise played Claus Von Stauffenberg,
                a German Army Colonel who was instrumental in the plot to assassinate the dictator
                and to take the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the
                country. Tom Cruise was attracted to this role based on his resemblance of his profile
                to the colonels. Eerie!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/rock-of-ages-.jpg"
                title="Rock of Ages; Tom Cruise as a Rockstar" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Released just last month, Rock of Ages is a comedy musical wherein Tom Cruise plays
                a fictional metal rocker Stacee Jaxx. Though regarded for its terrible script and
                excessive leads; Tom Cruise was highly appreciated by critics for his performance.
                Also, the movie holds the sixth-highest opening for a musical. And yes, Tom
                Cruise did sing his own songs in this one!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Tom-Cruise/oblivion.jpg"
                title="Oblivion" alt="" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                This one is about to come out in 2013 but remains highly anticipated. Cruise plays
                Tom Harper,one of the last remaining men on Earth, sent off to a mission on a faraway
                planet to destroy the remains of an alien race. The movie is awaited for its special
                effects and its action on which Tom Cruise always remains a star! Looking forward
                to it? We all are.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
