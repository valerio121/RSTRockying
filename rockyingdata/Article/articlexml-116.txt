  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    From the classic era of black and white cinema to modern times of the superhero,
    India has surprisingly maintained a niche for itself throughout Hollywood’s history.
    Two of the earliest movies about India are &lt;strong&gt;The Elephant Boy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mowgli&lt;/strong&gt;,
    black and white classics starring Sabu, the first true Indian Hollywood star. Ever
    since then, there still have been some singular moments of magnificent inspiration
    as well as times of sheer frustration when we saw India through the Hollywood lens.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Here are some of the most memorable ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    THE GOOD
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Many movies choose to limit their India to a few scenic shots of Goa, Varanasi or
    Leh- beautiful but pointless. It is Richard Attenborough’s Oscar winning &lt;strong&gt;Gandhi&lt;/strong&gt;
    which remains the most accurate and respected depiction of India ever. With its
    extended Indian cast, the exclusively Indian shoot and a brilliant performance by
    Ben Kingsley the movie has won the heart of every Indian who has ever watched it
    Classics such as &lt;strong&gt;Bhowani Junction&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Merchant- Ivory movies also
    appreciated the Indian way of life and showcased itin a real and sympathetic way.&lt;/p&gt;

    title="The Good " alt="" style="width: 700px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        Who here can forget Danny Boyle’s &lt;strong&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;/strong&gt;, a movie so real and
        moving; that we forget that it is a Hollywood movie at all!Of the more modern movies,
        &lt;strong&gt;Mission &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impossible: Ghost Protocol&lt;/strong&gt; was flattering in its own way,
        with its entire climax shot in a decidedly modern Mumbai and it’s up market and
        rich society (no beggars and snake charmers here!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    And Cinema fans would do well to check out the new Dev Patel starrer &lt;strong&gt;The Best
    &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exotic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marigold Hotel&lt;/strong&gt; as well, which opened to rave reviews in
    the UK recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
    THE BAD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There are few movies about India as downright stupid and offensive as the Steven
    Spielberg directed- Amrish Puri starrer &lt;strong&gt;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;.
    The blockbuster depicted a strange India of magic and child sacrifice with preposterous
    scenes (including one where monkey brains are served in a ‘traditional’ north Indian
    feast!) The movie was denied permission to shoot in India and decades after its
    release you will still not find the movie screened on any channel in India due to
    its offensive content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/HOllywood/India%20in%20Hollywood/The_Bad.jpg"
    title="The Bad" alt="" style="width: 700px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It is not just Hollywood. Even Jackie Chan’s &lt;strong&gt;The Myth&lt;/strong&gt; starring Mallika Sherawat
    is an extremely sorry portrayal of the country where India in its present day avatar
    is more backward than the China of Jackie Chan’s centuries old past life (they could
    practically fly back then whereas India is still a backward kingdom with veiled
    girls and dhoti clad villains!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Most Hollywood movies choose to focus on a painfully clichéd image of a India plagued
    with poverty and illiterate simpletons. Even the recent &lt;strong&gt;The Avengers&lt;/strong&gt; depicted
    Kolkata as something similar to a Somali warzone. Ironically the ‘Indian’ scenes
    in the movie were shot in Mexico.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    THE WEIRD
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    And then there are the strange ones. Those who defy all logic and common sense and
    are made with what seems like no research at all. Wes Anderson’s critically acclaimed
    &lt;strong&gt;The Darjeeling Limited &lt;/strong&gt;is a strange tale of an India we don’t know. Trains
    getting ‘lost’, a Darjeeling train that runs completely in the desert near Jaisalmer
    and sexy train ‘attendants’ willing to jump in bed with our gora heroes, this art
    house flick baffles us all despite having some big names like Owen Wilson and Irfaan
    Khan in its cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://rockying.com/art/HOllywood/India%20in%20Hollywood/The_Weird.jpg"
    title="THe Weird" alt="" style="width: 700px;" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        James Bond’s &lt;strong&gt;Octopussy&lt;/strong&gt; was another logic defying India-centric movie. With
        countless scenes of poverty all around including the mandatory shots of a cow in
        the street and a sadhu baba doing a rope trick along with a strange band of golden
        haired female assassins in a lake palace and a auto rickshaw chase sequence with
        Ashok Amritraj and Kabir Bedi made the movie a classic case of Hollywood’s myopic
        outlook of India.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Have we missed any portrayals of India in Hollywood? Tell us what you think about
    India’s interpretation by the west.

&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; Keeping her eyes closed, with long breaths and a gentle sound many mistake for snoring, actually helps Sonali think better. Or so she says. People question about these daily “thinking sessions”, mostly conducted on a comfortable couch or bed, while she claims that the long overdue best-seller she’s been working on (for quite some time now) will silence all the cynics. Till then she dreams on...
