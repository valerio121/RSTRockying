  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    Summer is here and with it is the insatiable urge of escaping somewhere that is
    greener, cooler and prettier than the dusty concrete jungles of our daily lives.
    What better place to run away to, if not the veritable ‘&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;paradise on earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;’-
    the beautiful state of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir"
        target="_blank"&gt;Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here are our recommendations of 5 must-do things when you are happily lost in the
    paradise:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    5. GO RELIGIOUS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Jammu%20n%20Kashmir/J.n.K.000.jpg" title="Go Religious in Jammu and Kashmir"
        alt="" style="height: 394px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    The state is a serene meeting place of India’s many religious beliefs. The famous
    &lt;b&gt;Charar-e-Sharif&lt;/b&gt; mosque and the &lt;b&gt;Shankaracharya temple&lt;/b&gt; coexist in harmony
    in Srinagar. The state is also steeped in Sufi mysticism and you will hear many
    an old tale of miracles and divine compassion at one of the innumerable ‘dargahs’.
    But the big ticket destinations here are the &lt;b&gt;Vaishno Devi Temple&lt;/b&gt; (at Katra,
    54 km from Jammu) and the grand pilgrimage of &lt;b&gt;Amarnath&lt;/b&gt;.
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;INSIDER'S TIP&lt;/b&gt;: Apart from temples, J&amp;amp;K h also has a myriad collection
    of forts &amp;amp; palaces. The Hari Niwas (Jammu) and the Moti Mahal (Poonch) will
    surprise you with hints of Irish in their architecture, whereas Leh will show you
    how a fort made of mud (Zorawar Fort) can survive for centuries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    4. GO TO THE VALLEY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Jammu%20n%20Kashmir/J.n.K.Collage.jpg" title="Go to The Valley and Road Tripping"
        alt="" style="width: 550px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;If there is a paradise on
    earth, this must be it. Srinagar valley, though scarred by years of political turmoil
    is still pretty as a picture. The &lt;b&gt;Dal Lake&lt;/b&gt; and its famous &lt;b&gt;shikaras&lt;/b&gt;,
    the spectacular natural vistas, the exotic flavors of &lt;b&gt;Wazwan cuisine&lt;/b&gt; and
    some swanky new hotels such as the &lt;b&gt;Taj Vivanta&lt;/b&gt; are once again attracting
    hordes of tourists back to the paradise.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;INSIDER'S TIP&lt;/b&gt;: if you are staying for long, try the various road trips to
    places like Kargil. Not very touristy but the place is sure to make your heart swell
    with pride at the sight of our brave jawaans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    3. GO ROAD TRIPPING!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If you like being behind the steering wheel and have an adventurous streak, J&amp;amp;K
    is the place for you. Raid de Himalaya is India’s foremost rally held annually honoring
    the challenging roads of the state.&amp;nbsp; The road trip to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/206"&gt;
        Leh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; via Manali is considered the Holy Grail for the many Enfield fanatics
    of India. There is also the new Mughal road, which runs from Jammu to Poonch and
    then on to Srinagar after crossing the magnificent Pir Panjal mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;INSIDER'S TIP&lt;/b&gt;: Mughal road was the route taken by the Mughal emperors&amp;nbsp;
    en route to the valley for a summer break and so you will find many ruins of medieval
    rest houses nestled amongst the absolutely unspoiled natural beauty of Poonch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    2. GO SKIING&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Jammu%20n%20Kashmir/gulmarg.jpg" title="Skiing In Gulmarg"
        alt="" style="width: 550px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;Gulmarg will surprise most
    first time visitors. Jaws will drop, cameras will be whipped out and the inevitable
    comparisons to the Swiss Alps will begin. The ski routes here are a treat for novices
    and pros alike and the state deservedly serves as the hub of the sport in India.
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;INSIDER'S TIP:&lt;/b&gt; Go exploring as well. The surrounding area is breathtakingly
    beautiful. Pine trees, pristine white snow and a small temple where Rajesh Khanna
    once sang ‘Jai Jai Shiv Shankar’, this is indeed a slice of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    1. GO TO LADAKH&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Jammu%20n%20Kashmir/Ladakh.jpg" title="Ladakh"
        alt="" style="width: 550px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;
    Simply put, there is no other place quite like &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/206"&gt;
        Ladakh&lt;/a&gt;. The famous ‘moonscape’ of one of India’s foremost tourist destination
    is a surreal sight. Drive across the 18380 ft high Khardung-La pass (once the highest
    road in the world), see the countless lakes in and around Ladakh (yes, the famous
    one in 3 Idiots is here too), get ‘attracted’ to the inexplicable magnetic hill
    and find some inner peace at the beautifully perched Shanti Stupa. Ladakh is the
    trip of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;INSIDER'S TIP&lt;/b&gt;: Don’t restrict your visit to Leh alone. Do cross over to the
    Nubra valley and see amazing sand dunes among the highest mountains in India as
    well as the rare twin-humped Bactrian camels.&lt;/p&gt;

    With the travel magazine &lt;a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india" target="_blank"&gt;
        Lonely Planet India&lt;/a&gt; voting Jammu and Kashmir as the best destination-emerging
    (India) for 2012, it's time that you shed all the concerns about the state and explore
    the paradise on earth.&lt;/h6&gt;</Text>
