    It's Valentine's! And we talk 'Love' today.&lt;img alt="Big grin" width="40" height="51"

&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Love, romance and passion have forever been synonymous with Bollywood. We love our
    love stories so much that every movie, whether an action flick or a slick thriller,
    produced in the Bollywood factories needs to have a huge helping of the old mushy
    feeling .Though there have been love stories of every color and form but memories
    of a few always remain etched in a soft, sensitive corner of our hearts till date.
    And from that very special corner of our hearts we bring you this list of sensitive
    love stories from the silver screen that not only left us spellbound but will also
    be cherished forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            JAANE TU YA JANE NA (Imran-Genelia)
        &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Jaane-Tu-Ya-jane-Na.JPG"
            alt="Jaane Tu Ya Jane Na" align="middle" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The comical love story between two college-going friends left many of us laughing,
            giggling and crying at the same time.The simple yet touching love story gave us
            two lovable friends who never knew they loved each other during college and discovered
            their feelings for each other only after they leave college and start looking for
            their dream partners. A very different take from run of the mill love stories, JTYJN
            showcased the search for partners by the lead couple and how that makes them realize
            the truth and brings them closer. Little gems like Naseeruddin Shah’s funky portrait
            and the hilarious “RanjorkeRathore” ensured that the movie was an instant hit with
            the younger generation. The music composed by A.R. Rehman became popular and“Pappu”
            who“Can’t Dance Sala” can still make you shake a leg at a party!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            MUGHAL-E-AZAM (Dilip Kumar-Madhubala)
        &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/mughal-e-azam.jpg"
            alt="Mughal-e-azam" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            “Pyar kiya to darna kya..." became the theme song for lovers who revolted against
            families and society for love back in the 50s and forever after. This epic period
            film starring Dilip Kumar and Madhubala is one of the best love stories ever produced
            in Bollywood. The movie depicted the doomed love story of the affluent Prince Salim
            and his courtesan Anarkali. The wrath of Emperor Akbar, the revolt of the young
            prince and the heart tugging, sorry end to their tale made the movie an all-time
            classic. Dilip Kumar caressing a stunningly beautiful Madhubala with a feather remains
            one of the most romantic scenes ever filmed in India. The film's colour version
            was released in November 2004 and found a whole new generation of new, devoted fans
            to the classic tale of Salim-Anarkali.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            MILI (Amitabh-Jaya)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Mili.jpg"
            alt="Mili" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s Mili remained one of the best movies made by mastero of the
            romance of everyday life. The movie is about the sensitive and beautiful love story
            between an effervescent Mili, played by Jaya Bachchan and a serious Shekhar, played
            by a brooding Amitabh Bachchan.The film shows how a recluse like Shekhar finds love
            in Mili and later discovers that Mili doesn’t have much time to live. It is Mili’s
            vivacity and positive outlook in spite of a rare disease that has left her with
            only a little time on earth that makes Shekhar (and all of us in the audience) fall
            in love with her fresh face, pig tailed beauty.
        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;datasource name="boxaddatasource" /&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            VEER ZARA (Shahrukh-Preity)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/veer-zaara.jpg"
            alt="Veer Zara" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The grandmaster of Bollywood love stories, Yash Chopra, took us beyond borders in
            this story about Veer, an Indian Air Force pilot, who falls in love with Zaara who
            belongs to Pakistan. The couple could never be united because of the opposition
            from Zaara’s politically strong family. It is after 22 long years, that a Pakistani
            lawyer played by Rani Mukherjee, tries to free Veer who has been languishing in
            a Pakistani jail and hears the heart wrenching story of Veer-Zaara. Shahrukh and
            Preity won audiences and critics alike with their sensitive portrayal.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            HUM TUM (Saif-Rani)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/hum-tum.jpg"
            alt="Hum Tum" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hum Tum gave us a love story that we had seen so often in lives- the inexplicable
            love between two people who differ in almost every aspect of life and could not
            stand each other each other for a second when they first meet. Moreover this story
            of the unlikely couple of Rhea(Rani) and Karan(Saif) shows us their life over years
            when they are separated by time and distance. A tale spanning continents and decades,
            the love story tells us how this most unlikely of pairs find their soulmates in
            each other. Director Kunal Kohli has never bested his efforts in this movie where
            every little aspect of the movie, from Saif’s boyish charms to the tragic death
            of Rani’s husband (a cameo by Abishek Bachchan) has been etched with a master’s
            touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            SOCHA NA THA (Abhay-Ayesha)
        &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Socha-Na-tha.jpg"
            alt="Scha Na Tha" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This was the debut movie of director Imtiaz Ali, who is well on his way to become
            the Yash Chopra of our times, and displayed his knack for sensitive and subtle story
            telling. Abhay Deol and Ayesha Takia shined in this tale of broken arranged marriages
            and complicated relationships. Abhay’s transformation mirrors almost every other
            love-struck Romeo today. Infatuation versus love is something that most of us are
            still not clear about and Socha Na Tha gives a picture of it brilliantly in Abhay’s
            character.The story of the couple, who meet through their parents, refuse an arranged
            marriage, go back to their long time partners only to finally realize that they
            have, despite all odds, fallen in love with each other. Sounds improbable? Believe
            in the power of Bollywood when it comes to romance and watch this flick which just
            might be the best love story you have ever seen!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            DIL SE (Shahrukh-Manisha)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Dil-Se-Still.jpg"
            alt="Dil Se" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Love story of a deranged terrorist and a chain smoking AIR journalist doesn’t sound
            very “sensitive” at first. But it is Mani Ratnam we are talking of and he pulled
            off the story perfectly in this doomed tale of love, politics and pure passion.
            With the amazing music by A.R. Rahman and some train top “chaiyya-chaiyya” by a
            smoking hot MalaikaArora, Dil Se also gave us some very sensitive potrayls of human
            frailties and passion. Manisha was at the peak of her acting career and Shah Rukh
            was, well Shah Rukh! Forget the politics in the movie and watch it for the very
            unlikely, very likeable love story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            BOMBAY (Arvind-Manisha)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Bombay.jpg"
            alt="Bombay" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Love has no religion. And all religions are basically loved. Mani Ratnam again gave
            us a classic story of the love between a Hindu boy and Muslim girl served with a
            twist. The two lovers from different religion fight against the society to reclaim
            their love and the real story of the movie only starts when they are married with
            two kids. Arvind Swamy’s brilliant role as an anguished father caught in the midst
            of the brutal Bombay riots touched every heart in the country. Rahman again gave
            us his best and Hariharan’s rendition of “Tu Hi Re” still gives us goose bumps.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            CHHOTI SI BAAT (Amol-Vidya)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/choti-si-baat.jpg"
            alt="Chhoti Si Baat" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A simple recipe of the love story of ordinary office going, local bus travelling,
            middle class people was garnished with generous helpings of quirky characters and
            clever storytelling and thus this amazing, simple and utterly loveable movie was
            born. Director Basu Chatterjee’s classic love story of the “aamaadmi” played by
            Amol Palekar and his hilarious attempts to woo his lady through the help of an unlikely
            love guru by the name of Colonel Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh (played brilliantly
            by Ashok Kumar) is an immensely likeable movie. Watch it if you haven’t seen it
            already. We bet that you will come back humming “Janeman” and thanking us for the
            tip!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            KATI PATANG (Rajesh-Asha)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/kati-patang.jpg"
            alt="Kati Patang" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Kati Patang is a tale of a girl Madhavi (Asha Parekh) with a broken heart and how
            she finds love in Kamal Sinha (Rajesh Khanna). But the later is unaware of her true
            identity. The movie revolves around the unusual circumstances in which she meets
            Kamal and both fall in love. She is torn between her heart and mind and starts avoiding
            Kamal fearing his resentment and hatred. The intense chemistry between the two and
            turmoil in their relationship makes this movie emotionally and romantically the
            best of our times.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            BARFI (Ranbir-Priyanka)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/Barfi_Still.jpg"
            alt="Barfi" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Bollywood doesn’t do love stories of deaf-mute and autistic people. Thankfully someone
            forgot to tell that to director Anurag Basu who made a movie where ever scene is
            to be loved and cherished by grateful audiences for long after. This year’s surprise
            hit romantic comedy gave us a love story that made us feel warm in the heart and
            fall in love with the characters and the beautiful locales of Darjeeling and old
            Calcutta where their astonishing tale is played out. Ranbir and Priyanka gave the
            best performances of their lives in the movie and the lovable crook “Barfi” jumped
            straight to the list of best Hindi movies ever made.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            PREM ROG (Rishi-Padmini)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/bollywood/Love-Stories-Bollywood/prem-rog.jpg"
            alt="Prem Rog" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This sensitive and arousing tale is about Manorama (Padmini Kolhapure), the chirpy
            only daughter of Chhote Raja Thakur and Devdhar (Rishi Kapoor), a poor orphan in
            the same village, who bids his childhood love a good bye and leaves for town as
            she leaves her paternal home awaiting a happy married life. But fate had thought
            otherwise. She is widowed within two days of marriage, alone and helpless she is
            also raped by her brother-in-law (Raza Muraad). Dev returns from town only to see
            Manorama in this pitiable state. He admits his feelings before every one and breaks
            all barriers to rescue her beloved from the cruel fangs of society. What awaits
            him is a bloody war between the right and the wrong.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;
    So that was our dose of a lil Bollywood mush for you. All left to be done is to snuggle
        up next to your loved one with a large tub of popcorn watching one of these movies
        this Valentine's Day. And when that heady, sweet rush called romance takes over,
        do tell us at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/RockyingMag" target="_blank"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt;
        how it went !
