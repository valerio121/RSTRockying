    If&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Rockying/Picture%201.jpg" title="Beer's To Happiness"

    you have read the title twice, yes you are right. Now you can think of having a
    beer or two to cure that nagging &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of yours, according to recent studies. A moderate proportion
    if taken as dosages can actually work miracles on your bones and keep your connecting
    tissues in good shape. Here is how:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Beer has dietary silicon that is the mantra for stronger bones. What one should
            be careful about is that not every beer brand has a malting process that would keep
            the silicon levels high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The trick is to check the color of the beer you are drinking. This might involve
            a lot of study and take some time. Go for the ones that are pale in color. The more
            golden the color, you must know that those are the ones to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            If you are suffering from arthritis or osteoporosis then, then say a strict no-no
            to fruit beers! Those are plainly high in calories and&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Rockying/Picture%202.jpg"
                title="Beer Fund" alt="" style="max-width: 208px;" class="pull-left" /&gt;
            have zero silicon content in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Do a basic Google search on the beers that follow the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"&gt;
                barley malting&lt;/a&gt; process. The beers made from wheat have low silicon content
            can therefore, is NOT the medicine for your bones!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    But does that mean you are going to get drunk every night? No! Two glasses of barley-malted
    beers can provide up to 30 to 40 mgs of silicon to your bones, even though there
    is no official recommendation for the number of doses that one can take. So, moderation
    is the guiding principle for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    So what are you waiting for? Start with a Beer Fund and save up for a glass full
    of bubbles and say cheers to health!
