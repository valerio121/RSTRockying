    October is known for many things - for global handwashing day, for Mahatma Gandhi’s
    birthday, but what it will be now known for is probably being the Pink Month!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Breast-Cancer-Awareness/Breast-Awareness-Go-Pink.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;
    Pink Month is associated with the Breast Cancer Awareness Month. A whole month dedicated
    to awareness related to a form of cancer that is rapidly growing due to ignorance
    and delay in diagnosis. Though many detected cases in the US have high chances of
    treatment due to early diagnosis, treatment plans and awareness among patients;
    the scenario in India is not the same. Most of the cancer cases go undetected and
    those that are, run into problems due to extreme lack of awareness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    A LITTLE IN NUMBER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here’s a little number proof to show you why we need to taking breast cancer awareness
    seriously in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Breast Cancer is the most common form of cancer in India and is the second most
        common form of cancer in rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It accounts from around 25 to 30 % of cancer in females in cities like Mumbai, Delhi,
        Bengaluru, Bhopal, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Compared to data collected over the past 30 years, breast cancer has seen a steady
        rise in the population between the age group 25 to 40 years of age.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even after detection, the overall cancer survival rate in India is not more than
        60 % which is disturbing because countries, like the US are seeing a close to 90%
        survival rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    SO WHAT IS BREAST CANCER?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As the name suggests, cancer or malignant tumor that starts in the tissues of the
    breast is known as breast cancer. There are two kinds - one that originates in the
    tubes that carry milk from the breast to the nipple and the other kind is the one
    that starts in the parts of the breasts called lobules which produce milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Breast-Cancer-Awareness/Go-Pink.jpg"
    alt="" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here are some facts, mixed with information to make sure you are more aware about
    what should be done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            SCREENING : Finding out if there is any problem or not&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Since early detection is a major problem and issue in India, the first thing you
            should be doing is to go get yourself screened. Not many of us know the symptoms
            and the consequences so the smart thing to do is get yourself evaluated - you don’t
            have to be waiting for the symptoms to occur. Go for a cancer screening just to
            find out if there is anything to worry about or not. Remember, cancer goes through
            a series of stages - the earlier the stage, the better the chances of treatment;
            the earlier the detection, the better the chances of knowing what to do further.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            SELF BREAST EXAMINATION&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            As implied, it is the process of looking at, touching and feeling your breasts for
            any problems. It is recommended that women over 20 do a monthly self examination.
            Women in their 20s and 30s are advised to have a clinical exam (Mammography) done
            by a physician at least once every three years and women over 40 should get a clinical
            exam done every year. The process is painless, easy to do and is effective in knowing
            any abnormalities as soon as they occur. &lt;a href="http://women.webmd.com/healthtool-self-breast-exam"
                target="_blank"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an article to show you how it is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            KNOW YOUR FAMILY HISTORY&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There is a hereditary element in breast cancer - so knowing your family medical
            history is always the best thing to do. If there have been cases, then the screening
            is better done as soon as you are in your 20s. Get in touch with your doctor and
            consult on what screening is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            NOTICE BREAST CHANGES&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There are some particular symptoms you should look out for - change in breast shape,
            pulling in nipples or other parts of the breast, nipple discharge that starts suddenly,
            swelling, warmth, darkness of breast, lump or hard know in the breast of in the
            underarm area, itch, sore or rash on nipple. Respond to symptoms by getting yourself
            checked. It might not be cancer, but it is always better to stay careful.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;
            HEALTHY LIFESTYLE&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One thing that never goes out of fashion - keeping your weight under check. Eating
            nutritious food, having a well balanced diet, regular exercise and limiting alcohol
            intake are things one needs to keep in mind. Also, women should be limiting use
            of postmenopausal hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The first step towards a better healthier lifestyle is awareness and breast cancer
    still runs into a lot of awareness issues in our country. Be aware, get yourself
    and encourage your family and friends to go for their screening too. It only takes
    a short time and it helps you take the first step towards beating cancer!&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
