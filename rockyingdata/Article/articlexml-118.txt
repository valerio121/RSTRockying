&lt;h3&gt;
    Situation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Hannah, a fresh graduate interning with a local news channel, is steadily typing
    on her keyboard and she still has not realized that it is 3 o’clock in the morning.
    &lt;br&gt;
    1 notification received which is most obviously notifies a crush. It is very obvious
    that Hannah considers it safer to desire a person virtually. Comforted over a mushy
    chat session, she sleeps. Love blossoms over a few days of steady exchange of pings
    and bingo! - the relationship status changes from ‘single’ to ‘in a relationship’
    on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. By the time Hannah’s friends
    are about to understand what changed Hannah’s mind so quickly, &lt;a href="//rockying.com/"&gt;
        Rockying&lt;/a&gt; is here to explore how these dating portals sustain and bring forth
    serious concerns such as dating frauds and misleading identities related to it.&lt;br&gt;
    Even though Hannah sleeps comforted that night, it sure does set our minds thinking
    about the recent changes that online dating has faced in the recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;The Trend&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Not all dating sites encourage explicit conversations. But none of them encourage
        people to meet in person as well. A dating site creates multiple level of contacts
        (chat rooms, emails, SMSs, phone conversations, snail
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/internet/Internet%20Dating/online%20dating7.jpg"
            title="Memorial To The Much Desired Husband" alt="" style="width: 400px; float: right;"&gt;mails)
        with the person, yet there is no guarantee of an actual relationship happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
            Online dating is like a cryptic existence that knows no limits of desire or thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
                95% of people who get hooked up online are not able to sustain their relationship
                for more than 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chat rooms create attraction-based relationship rather
                    than love-based ones. Not many people are able to sustain an online relationship
                    because of distance, medium of communication, risk of people faking personalities
                    and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The “perfect husband/partner” myth is circulated much more conveniently.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    The Why-Factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drastic-ego boost. The fact that hundreds of men would drop their caps and women
        let their hair down at the onset of “Hi, Linda, 23, female, Toronto” is a great
        way to massage one’s ego- no matter how lonely they are in real life.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sympathy is easily generated in online chat rooms. There are several instances where
        a divorced husband confessed how his ex-wife accused him of slapping her or a heart
        broken spinster whined about her backstabbing boyfriend.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are several cases of chat sessions leading to people getting laid for casual
        sex. Cyber sex is another option why people indulge in video chats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a woman/man
            of any age you want irrespective of what age group you belong to!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual sex
                is much safer than one-night stands. Hands down! One can easily turn the “intense”
                knob or the “tacky” knob and regulate the intensity of cyber sex. Every human is
                voyeuristic at some level or the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attraction works! And that happens quickly
                    than falling in love. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Everybody seems to have a reason to go online and hunt for that perfect date. What
    is your reason? Single, almost single, somewhere in between the two, loneliness
    or plain boredom??? Good, bad, ugly, online dating sure form the underbelly of the
    cyber world. We say, it is a necessary evil. Rockying just pledges a safe online
    dating environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Just keep in mind the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do not give away your exact location. Ever! It is easy to win someone’s confidence
        online but is it worth the risk? Ask yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video chats definitely add to
            the voyeuristic aspect but it has the risk of being traded into porn sites. So,
            beware!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not forget to keep a mail id separately for these activities. Malwares
                have the potential to steal information from your ids and create problems for you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Everybody has had a share of this piece of cake called Online Dating. So, it is
    tough to say if at all one can get rid of this fad. The only trick is to understand
    when this gets transformed from momentary fun to something which is unreal and imaginative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;
    So what say? Have you “shopped” for your ideal dating partner yet? Got ditched or
    hitched...tell us your experience.
