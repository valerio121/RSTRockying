    all of us stress importance on exercising the body, many of us forget that the brain
    needs exercise too. The brain is an organ and it needs oxygen, it needs exercise
    just like any other organ. So, while physical invigoration is achieved through an
    hour on the treadmill, there are many more ways in which the mind can just be treated
    the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Keeping the mind active protects the brain from brain loss and from slowing of thought.
    Also, an active mind is effective in decision making, problem solving and in protecting
    your mind from early stagnation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, here are some simple things to jog that always rested brain; believe me, they
    aren’t tiring but they will have the mind energized!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;READ, READ AND READ MORE&lt;/strong&gt;
            The most loved and the most relaxing mind exercise.&amp;nbsp; There are loads of books
            to be chosen from – literature, history, thriller, business, romance to any genre
            that is of your liking. Not only do you absorb a lot of information, you learn new
            words and you will have a lot of things to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;TAKE A COURSE&lt;/strong&gt; Get out of your comfort zone; go learn something
            totally new and you have been wanting for a long time. Take up cooking classes,
            learn a new language, take up a new sport, learn an instrument; the whole idea is
            to challenge your mind to think outside the box&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;SOLVE THE CASE&lt;/strong&gt; Pick up your daily newspapers, you will find them
            filled with puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku and other word and number games. Indulge
            in them, make it a routine. Through these you work on your language, your spelling
            and mathematical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;A WORD A DAY&lt;/strong&gt; Make it a habit to learn one new word daily. This
            helps in pushing the mind to its extremes and in improving memory and in bettering
            your retention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;USE YOUR NON-DOMINANT HAND&lt;/strong&gt; This might be a lot of fun and can have
            wondrous effects. Try using your non dominant hand (the hand which you do not use
            to write or are not comfortable with otherwise) for different activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE MORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/Exercise.jpg"

            Really, there are no two ways about this. Everyone needs exercise. Indulge in the
            usual – jogging, walking, running, swimming. Try out new ways of physical workout,
            learn yoga, sign up for aerobics, play sports. But yes, exercise never goes out
            of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The world we live in offers us constant opportunities through which we can work
    on our health and mental well being. The trick is to grab them and make use of the
    best for us. Your brain needs a fitness program and you are the only one who can
    give in to its demands. Listen to your body and brain and keep them both active
    – always!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Do tell us your fitness mantra? What do you do to keep the neurons all charged up
    always?&lt;/h4&gt;</Text>
