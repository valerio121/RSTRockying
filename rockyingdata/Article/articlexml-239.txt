            &lt;p&gt;
                The earliest known shoes are sandals dating from approximately 7,000 or 8,000 B.C.,
                found in the Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon. In 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                Oldest Leather Shoe&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/2-the oldest know leather shoe about 5500 years old found in armenia.jpg"
                alt="the oldest know leather shoe about 5500 years old found in armenia" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The world's oldest leather shoe, made from a single piece of cowhide laced with
                a leather cord along seams at the front and back, was found in a cave in Armenia
                in 2008 and is believed to date to 3,500 B.C.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                alt="Ötzi the Iceman shoe" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Otzi the Iceman's shoes, dating to 3,300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin
                side panels, and a bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Moccasin&lt;/h3&gt;

                alt="Soft Moccasin" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Many early natives in North America wore a similar type of footwear known as the
                moccasin. These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out of leather
                or bison hides. Moccasins were not designed to get wet, and in wet weather and warm
                summer months, most Native Americans went barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;

                Thong Sandals&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/5-thong sandals.jpg"
                alt="Thong Sandals" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                As civilizations began to develop, thong sandals were worn. This practice dates
                back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptians murals from 4,000 B.C. Thong sandals
                were worn by many civilizations and made from a wide variety of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 50px;"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Thong Sandals&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;ol&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;One pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately,
                    1500 years old. They were also worn in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus Christ.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/5-indian thong sandals.jpg"
                        alt="" style="height: 248px; width: 318px" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                    In India, they were made from wood. &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;In china and Japan rice straw was used to make thong sandals.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America,
                    while the natives of Mexico used the yucca plant.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Espadrille&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/6-espadrille.jpg"
                alt="" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                A common casual shoe in the Pyrenees during the Middle Ages are espadrilles. These
                are sandals with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often include
                fabric laces that tie around the ankle. The shoes originate in the Catalonian region
                of Spain as early as the 13th century, and were commonly worn by peasants in the
                farming communities in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Patten Shoe&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/7-patten shoe.jpg"
                alt="" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                By the 15th Century, pattens became popular by both men and women in Europe. These
                are commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe, while the poor
                and lower classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, and were barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Crakow Shoe&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/8-crakow shoe.jpg"
                alt="" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                In the 15th century, the Crakow was fashionable in Europe. This style of shoe is
                named because it is thought to have originated in Krakow, the capitol of Poland.
                The style is characterized by the point of the shoe, known as the "polaine", which
                often was supported by a whalebone tied to the knee to prevent the point getting
                in the way while walking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Chopine Shoe&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/9-chopine shoe.jpg"
                alt="" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Also during the 15th century, chopines were created in Turkey, and were usually
                7-8 inches (17.7-20.3 cm) high. These shoes became popular in Venice and throughout
                Europe, as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th
                century, royalty started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger
                than life, such as Catherine de Medici or Mary I of England. By 1580, even men wore
                them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as, "well-heeled".&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Turn Shoe Method&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Lifestyle/Fashion/History-of-shoes/11-welted method shoe.gif"
                alt="" /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Many medieval shoes were made using the turnshoe method of construction, in which
                the upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to
                the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside.
                Some shoes were developed with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather
                around the foot for a better fit. The turn shoe method was replaced by the welted
                method around 1500.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;
                Modern Shoe&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Eventually the modern shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the 17th century,
                most leather shoes have used a sewn-on sole. This remains the standard for finer-quality
                dress shoes today. Until around 1800, shoes were made without differentiation for
                the left or right foot. Such shoes are now referred to as "straights". Only gradually
                did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Since the mid-20th Century, advances in rubber, plastics, synthetic cloth, and industrial
                adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from
                traditional crafting techniques. Leather, which had been the primary material in
                earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but athletic shoes
                often have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched
                on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on. Many of these newer
                materials, such as rubber and plastics, have made shoes less biodegradable. It is
                estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill.
                In the late 2000s, some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes
                made entirely from degradable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
