  <Text>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;o, who doesn’t like a good monster movie? Shots of buildings being decimated,
    people running for their lives, cars being flung like toys and military weapons
    being reduced to nothing are clichés that have survived the test of time in the
    battle for box office glory. While several creatures in cinemas like the dinosaurs
    in JURRASIC PARK and the shark in JAWS have terrified us, we steer clear of real
    life monster (alive or extinct) in this list and bring you the movies with the most
    terrifying, and sometimes bizarre, monsters that can only be created in a Hollywood
    studio. Here are the best of Hollywood’s Monster Madness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE FLY&lt;/b&gt;“&lt;i&gt; be afraid… be very afraid&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;img style="width: 400px; float: right;"
        title="The Fly Monster" alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movie%20monsters/the%20fly1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The 1986 Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis starrer is a tale of a brilliant and disturbed
    a scientist who is researching teleportation. When he conducts his experiment on himself,
    he is accidentally merged with a housefly on a genetic level. It is then that this
    little known classic transforms into a genuine and horrifying masterpiece. The monster
    of THE FLY does not destroy entire cities like some others in this list but is without
    a doubt the creepiest among all of them. Director David Cronenberg’s remake of a
    1958 horror movie of the same name went on to win accolades, millions of dollars
    on the box office and even an Oscar for its gruesome makeup. A series of forgettable
    sequels followed but none matched the success of the original. Watch it for Jeff
    Goldblum’s brilliant performance, the disturbing man-fly effects, and the creepy
    feeling that is going to linger on for a long, long time.&lt;br&gt;

        frameborder="0" height="300" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOVERFIELD&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img style="width: 400px; float: right;" title="The Cloverfield Monster"
        alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movie%20monsters/Cloverfield%20monster.jpg"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Produced by J. J. Abrams (the man who created the hit TV series LOST) and directed
    by Matt Reeves, this 2008 summer blockbuster featured a host of little known actors
    playing a group of friends in New York at a party when an unnamed monster attacks
    the city. One of the characters named Hud is recording the party through his Handycam
    and it is through this camera the rest of the movie is shown, giving it a unique
    documentary-cum-Youtube feel (as seen in movies like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT&amp;nbsp;
    &amp;amp; PARANORMAL ACTIVITY). CLOVERFIELD brilliantly combines elements from the classic
    monster-attacking-city movies of the past with a radical new cinematography technique
    and modern-day special effects and is credited with having brought back to life
    the monster movie genre. Best watched on the largest screen you can manage with
    the sound turned all the way up!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img style="height: 300px; float: left;" title="The Alien Monster" alt=""
    src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movie%20monsters/alien_monster.jpg"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALIEN&lt;/b&gt;
“&lt;i&gt;in space no one can hear you scream&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Call it horror, sci-fi, or monster movie, Ridley Scott’s 1979 genre-defying masterpiece
    will still send a chill down your spine. The movie told us the harrowing tale of
    a group of miners on the space ship Nostromo who are summoned by a distress call
    from an unknown planetoid. They gradually end up as prey for a grisly alien creature
    that rips apart the team, one member at a time. The slow creeping horror of the
    the movie combined with some brilliant design work done by the twisted Swedish artist
    H R Giger created the fearsome Alien that is still counted as the best movie monster
    of all time and a movie that features in every all-time greatest movie list. The
    unforgettable face-hugging alien, its horrific chest busting spawn, and the fully
    grown monster is the stuff of nightmares and ensures that despite four more successful
    movies have, including one made by none other than James Cameron, you never forget
    your first time with the ALIEN.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;KING KONG&lt;/b&gt; “&lt;i&gt;it was beauty that killed the beast&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;img style="width: 400px;
        float: right;" title="King Kong Monster" alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movie%20monsters/King_Kong_2005.jpg"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The greatest monster movie of all time is also one of the very earliest.&amp;nbsp;
    Writer-director Merian C Cooper created this cinematic masterpiece way back in 1933
    and his stop motion animation created giant ape is still more evocative and believable
    than many CGI monsters of present-day Hollywood. A movie renowned for its vision,
    its outstanding background score, its sensitive screenplay of a monster besotted
    by a beautiful woman and its groundbreaking special effects, KING KONG has inspired
    scores of moviemakers down the years. Though the story has seen many remakes, the
    The most notable one being the recent faithful adaptation of the black and white classic
    by Peter Jackson in 2005 (that is the version you will find on most movie channels),
    the original is still considered to be the best. Watch the iconic scene involving
    Kong climbing the Empire State building and you will agree that despite the dated
    special effects and the grainy images, KING KONG remains one of the most powerful
    of all monster movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;GODZILLA&lt;/b&gt; “&lt;i&gt;size does matter&lt;/i&gt;!”&lt;img style="height: 300px; float: left;"
        title="Godzilla" alt="" src="//rockying.com/art/HOllywood/Movie%20monsters/Godzilla%20hollywood.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Not just the 1998 Hollywood version of the monster but the original giant lizard
    we all know and love from the classic Japanese movies, Godzilla is the god of monster
    flicks.&amp;nbsp; Called Gojira in Japan the iconic movie monster has starred in a total
    of 28 films since its screen debut in 1954 fighting some of the most outlandish
    monsters on the screen including a giant butterfly MOTHRA, a robotic MECHAGODZILLA and
    even the giant ape KING KONG himself! Japan’s monster specialist Toho Studio’s (we
    could do a list of weirdest movie monsters based solely on their productions) best
    known creation is a hit with fans all over the world with his characteristic roar,
    gigantic frame and atomic breath (YEAH!!) Starting as an out and out monster, Godzilla
    has transformed into a hero of sorts in his recent appearances in Japan and has
    even earned his own star on the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame in the process!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Scary, aren't they? We still loved the thrill and excitement they gave us. Tell
    us who your favorite (spine-chillingly) is? Go scare the comment box away !&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; Keeping her eyes closed, with long breaths and a gentle sound many mistakes for snoring, actually helps Sonali think better. Or so she says. People question about these daily “thinking sessions”, mostly conducted on a comfortable couch or bed, while she claims that the long overdue best-seller she’s been working on (for quite some time now) will silence all the cynics. Till then she dreams on...
