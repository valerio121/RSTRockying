                    World’s First Digital Camera (1975) Created by Kodak's engineer Steve Sasson&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Digital-Camera.jpg"
                    title="First Digital Camera" alt="" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In December 1975, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson invented something that would, decades
                    later, revolutionize photography: the world’s first digital camera. It was the size
                    of a toaster, and captured black and white images at a resolution of 100×100 - or
                    0.01 megapixels in today’s marketing terminology. The images were stored on cassette
                    tape, taking 23 seconds to write.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The camera uses an ADC from Motorola, a bog-standard (for the 1970s) lens from a
                    Kodak movie camera, and a CCD chip from Fairchild Semiconductor - the same technology
                    that digital cameras still use today. To playback the images, a special computer
                    and tape reader setup (pictured below) was built, outputting the grainy images on
                    a standard TV. It took a further 23 seconds to read each image from tape.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Motel (1925): Motel InnWorld’s First Motel
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Motel.jpg"
                    title="First Motel" alt=""  /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Motel Inn in San Luis Obispo, California, is the world’s first motel. It was built
                    in 1925 by LA architect Arthur Heineman, who coined the term motel meaning "motor
                    hotel.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Motel Inn was originally called the Milestone Mo-Tel. Back then, one night stay
                    was $1.25. Heineman couldn’t afford the trademark registration fee, so his competitors
                    were able to use the word "motel." The motel is still in operation today.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Album Cover (1938): Smash Song Hits by Rodgers and Hart:
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Album-Cover.jpg"
                    title="First Album Cover" alt="" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Before Alex Steinweiss, then a 23-year-old designer, invented album covers in 1938
                    for Columbia Records, albums were sold in plain brown wrappers.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The album "Smash Song Hits by Rodgers and Hart" was the very first album cover in
                    the world&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Novel (1007): Tale of Genji
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Novel.jpg"

                &lt;p&gt;
                    More than a thousand years ago, on 1007, a Japanese court lady put the finishing
                    touches on what is considered the world's first novel.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Spanning 75 years, more than 350 characters, and brimming with romantic poems, the
                    "Tale of Genji" tells the story of an emperor's son, his quest for love, and the
                    many women he meets along the way.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It is attributed to the Japanese noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Web Server and Web Site (1990): a NeXT computer at CERN

                    Info.cern.ch was the address of the world's first-ever web site and web server,
                    running on a NeXT computer at CERN.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html,
                    made by Tim Berners-Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

                    World's First Motorcycle (1885): Daimler's "riding car":
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Motor_cycle.jpg"
                    title="First MotorCycle" alt=""  /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The First Motorcycle was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler
                    and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt (Stuttgart) in 1885.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It was essentially a motorized bicycle, although the inventors called their invention
                    the Reitwagen ("riding car").&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It was also the first petroleum-powered vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" &gt;

                    World's First X-Ray (1895): Röntgen's wife hand
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-X-ray.jpg"
                    title="First X-RAy" alt=""  /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In 1895 Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, professor of physics the University of Wurburg in
                    Germany, was doing experiments with electrical discharges in evacuated glass tubes.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Late in 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen was alone at night doing his experiments, this time
                    in the dark and noticed a glow was produced on the wall, which he knew was not caused
                    by fluorescence or visible light.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    He named these new, unidentified rays 'X' or if you prefer; X-rays. After several
                    months of playing with his discovery he noticed that objects place in the path of
                    the rays cast shadows and created images on the wall.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Soon after he used a photgraphic plate and had his wife, Frau Röntgen, place her
                    hand in the path of the X-rays, creating the world's first X-ray picture. In 1901
                    Wilhelm Röntgen was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Computer Mouse (1964): by Douglas Engelbart
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Computer-Mouse.jpg"
                    title="First Computer Mouse" alt=""  /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The world's first computer mouse was made by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, it consisted
                    of two gear-wheels positioned perpendicular to each other -- allowing movement on
                    one axis.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Ergonomic shape, great button placement -- and it's made of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide" &gt;
            &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;
                    World's First Skyscraper (1885): Home Insurance Building in Chicago
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Skyscraper.jpg"
                    title="First Skyscraper" alt="" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Considered to be the first skyscraper in the world due to the building's unique
                    architecture and unique weight bearing frame, the Home Insurance Building was built
                    in 1885 in Chicago, Illinois and demolished in 1931 to make way for the Field Building
                    (now the LaSalle National Bank Building).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It was the first building to use structural steel in its frame, but the majority
                    of its structure was composed of cast and wrought iron. It was the first tall building
                    to be supported, both inside and outside, by a fireproof metal frame.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It had 10 stories and rose to a height of 138 feet (42 m) high.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Concept Car (1938): Buick Y-Job
                &lt;/h4&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                    Designed in 1938 by the famous General Motors designer Harley Earl, the Buick Y-Job
                    is considered by most to be the first concept car.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The car had power-operated hidden headlamps, "gunsight" hood ornament, wraparound
                    bumpers, flush door handles, and prefigured styling cues used by Buick until the
                    1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First MP3 Player (1998): MPMan 32MB
                &lt;/h4&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                    Released in 1998, the Eiger Labs MPMan was the world's first MP3 player, boasting
                    32MB of internal memory -- expandable to 64MB.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Available in F10 or F20 models, the latter boasting SmartMedia compatibility, this
                    player set you back a mere $69 + shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It measures a slim 91 x 70 x 16.5 mm.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    World's First Crossword (1913): Arthur Wynne's Invention
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                    In 1913, Arthur Wynne had the job of devising the weekly puzzle page for Fun, the
                    eight-page comic section of the New York World, a major newspaper of the time.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    When he devised what he called a Word-cross for the Christmas edition, published
                    on 21 December, he could have no idea that he would be starting a worldwide craze.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h4&gt;
                    World's First Microprocessor (1971): Intel 4004
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Microprocessor.jpg"
                    title="First Microprocessor" alt=""  /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In November, 1971, a company called Intel publicly introduced the world's first
                    single chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004 (U.S. Patent #3,821,715), invented by
                    Intel engineers Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stan Mazor.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    After the invention of integrated circuits revolutionized computer design, the only
                    place to go was down -- in size that is.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    The Intel 4004 chip took the integrated circuit down one step further by placing
                    all the parts that made a computer think (i.e. central processing unit, memory,
                    input and output controls) on one small chip.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                    Programming intelligence into inanimate objects had now become possible.&lt;/p&gt;

                    World's First Magazine (1731): The Gentleman's Magazine
                &lt;/h4&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                    The Gentleman's Magazine, first published in 1731, in London, is considered to have
                    been the first magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Edward Cave, who edited The Gentleman's Magazine under the pen name "Sylvanus Urban",
                    was the first to use the term "magazine", on the analogy of a military storehouse
                    of varied materiel, originally derived from the Arabic makazin "storehouses".&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    It ceased publication in September, 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h4&gt;
                    World's First Photograph (1826): "View from the Window at Le Gras"
                &lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Initiative/World%20First/First-Photograph.jpg"
                    title="First Photograph" alt="" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Centuries of advances in chemistry and optics, including the invention of the camera
                    obscura, set the stage for the world’s first photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In 1826, French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, took that photograph, titled
                    View from the Window at Le Gras at his family’s country home.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Niépce produced his photo—a view of a courtyard and outbuildings seen from the house’s
                    upstairs window—by exposing a bitumen-coated plate in a camera obscura for several
                    hours on his windowsill.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
