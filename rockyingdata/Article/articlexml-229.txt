    Shadow and light are the two forces which fill the fervor in music. As politics
    of hatred is eclipsing humanity and world is entering the troubled waters of religious
    tyranny, with the growth of neo-fundamentalism; the revival of Sufi Music in India
    can be seen as a resistance sans bias. Sufism is the practice in which wandering
    saints and dervishes sought to attain the ultimate spiritual realization through
    their poetry, music and dance. It is said that the essence of Sufi Poetry is its
    capability to push one into a trance like state in which a person can unite with
    almighty Allah. The most famous form of Sufi Music that originated in India and
    Pakistan is the Qawwali. It later gained global recognition by the name of great
    singers like Shankar-Shambhu and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Qawwali was bestowed upon
    India by the great Sufi poet Amir Khusrau Dehalvi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    One of the pioneers of modern day Sufi Music, Nusrat Fateh Ali khan only took the
    brotherhood of Sufi Secularism a step ahead with his songs equipped with apt musical
    background to set the tempo for the new age audience only to maintain the impeccable
    heart wrenching impact, the true mark of Sufi Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Sufi Music has travelled through the deserts of Africa to the shores of Atlantic
    Ocean and has reached India crossing the mountains of Iran and Pakistan. The modern
    day Sufi music be it from Pakistani bands Jal and Junoon or their Indian counterparts
    is a result of its revival in new form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Rabbi Shergills, Bulla ki jana main kaun, is only one of the many examples where poetry of Bulley
    Shah and music of rock culture is fused to create an emotionally churning effect.
    Music and sound is the soul of Sufi Music. The act of singing, chanting, listening
    and whirling to the recitation of poetry and music is common to Sufi orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Contemporary Sufi Music emerged as a new wave in 1990 enlivened by Junoon for the
    new era. Vital Signs, Mekal Hasan, Fuzon, Strings and myriad other bands followed
    the trend and joined the genre of Sufi Rock to reach the million hearts already
    moved by this innovative fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Songs like Sayonee, Yaar Bina, Mohe Apne Rang Mein and Saanwal Yaar was the hum
    and hymn of every lip and suddenly the college canteens saw a revival of new creed
    of budding singers following the footsteps of mystically attractive young men like
    Atif Aslam, Raghu and Kailash Kher. Music was the soul of this new movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    College fest had new music for their jam sessions and bands like Euphoria and Parikrama
    was quickly replaced by Sufi Bands, which were known for experimenting constantly
    with music. It came in vogue and Sufi songs became the love anthem of the new age
    love birds going mad singing Teri Diwani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Earlier Sufi saints recited their song with traditional instruments like dhol, chimta
    and tumba in praise of god. In India it could be traced back to Khwaja Moinuddin
    Chisti and his introduction of Chistiyyah in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The genre has borrowed greatly from the folk tradition of the Northern Indian region
    around which it evolved only to fuse the mystical poetry with a kind of music which
    had the power of causing powerful emotional effect among its audience with the constant
    chanting of the name of god known as Zikr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    However the music has evolved with age and time. Only thing that helped the revival
    of Sufism in India almost after two centuries is the current socio-religious conditions
    and the growing metropolitan culture in the cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The revival of Sufism had both anger and unrest in form of classical western rock
    culture fused with the suave and serine verses of Sufi poetry and giving birth to
    a powerful music which can churn the very core of the heart of an individual. It
    is both powerful and peaceful a combination which instantly clicked with the youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Hard punk metal band, guitar and bass drum in the background topped with Sufi Relics
    instantly became the religious hymn of the generation-next. Since 2008 coke studio
    emerged in Pakistan, a musical collection which was a blend of spirituality and
    music on the lines of Sufi Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;By 2012 coke studio Pakistan became a phenomenon after featuring five seasons. Amazing
    vocals synchronized with awesome music filled the heart of the listeners like the
    wine from Bacchus's own bar.
