        &lt;button id="prevslide" type='button' style='width: 40px; height: 40px; font-size: 50px;
            font-weight: 100; color: #000; border: none; text-align: center; margin: 0px;

            &amp;rsaquo;
        &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="slideshow"&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/fun.jpg" alt="Fun while exercising" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Letâ€™s admit it. Its tiring and very very boring to keep running on the treadmill
                and keep doing the elliptical and that monotonous cycling. Even the regular aerobic
                sessions can get a little tedious over time. We have been there, done that and chances
                are that if you aren't motivated, if you aren't having fun, you will drop out too
                soon.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                So, Rockying decides to up the fun factor in losing weight too. Why not find out
                more interesting ways to burn calories and manage to keep weight loss fun. We outline
                some of the best ways to lose weight and have some fun while at it! Slide on!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/hula-hoop.jpg"
                alt="Hula hoops" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;HULA HOOPS&lt;/b&gt; - Yes, you must have played these as kids. But have you ever realized
                how much worthy they can be for losing weight. A recent study by the American Council
                on Exercise found that intermediate level hula hooping can burn as many calories
                per minute as step aerobics or brisk walking. Besides that, it helps tone abs, back,
                thighs, arms and legs. To begin, get a large, heavy hula hoop, preferably one that
                comes up to your waist. Stay away from the kiddie versions in the markets; they
                can be too tight and small.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/salsa-dance.jpg"
                alt="Salsa" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;SALSA DANCING&lt;/b&gt; - Salsa is quite the rage everywhere now. Just like the elliptical,
                it involves movements of the hips. A lot of studios offer classes; find one close
                to you an enroll yourself. Not only is it calorie burning, it helps tone your lower
                body and strengthen your calves. Also, you learn a new dance form.You will be surprised
                by how quickly time passes when you are in your salsa shoes! And what's more fun
                than dancing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/hikiing.jpg" alt="Hiking" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;HIKING&lt;/b&gt; - Instead of lifting weights and doing the whole weight training;
                try filling your bag with stuff (maybe even your books!). Not only walking with
                weights is like a constant cardio, hiking helps in increasing muscle mass, increases
                bone density and on forestalling conditions like osteoporosis. Also, make sure you
                are hiking with poles. If you are walking uphill, the benefits gets extremely increased.
                Pack your bags this weekend and go hiking with friends.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/Skipping-rope.jpg"
                alt="Rope Jumping" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;ROPE JUMPING&lt;/b&gt;- Another favorite activity as a kid but did you know that just
                fifteen minutes of rope jumping can burn up to 200 calories? Not only that but it
                also strengthens your muscles and bones and improves coordination. Its like a full
                body cardiovascular workout. Make sure you do this while wearing cross-trainers
                (kind of sports shoes) that absorb the impact of jumping on the balls of your feet.
                Aim for three ten minute rope jumping every week for better results.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/yoga.jpg" alt="Yoga" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;YOGA&lt;/b&gt;- Probably one of the oldest forms of exercises and still loved by the
                weight loss experts. Yoga can be wondrous to work out - ranging from low intensity
                to extremely tough poses; yoga tackles every part of the body and the mind. Not
                only is it helpful in weight loss it strengthens muscles, improves blood circulation,
                flexibility, strength, stamina, balance, tackles body aches, helps in better sleep,
                tones your body from tip to toe, gives you a better posture and increases immunity.
                Not only this, but yoga is said to have a calming effect on the body. With so many
                benefits, yoga is something you should take up right away. But remember, begin with
                a professional for better learning of asanas and what kind of postures is right
                for you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/Pilates.jpg" alt="Pilates" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;PILATES&lt;/b&gt;- A system of physical fitness developed by Joseph Pilates in the
                early 20th century. Pilates called his method Contrology (from Control). Pilates
                developed his method as mat exercises but slowly introduced apparatus to help workout
                better. Though this is more popular in the US, UK and some European countries; pilates
                is soon catching up in other parts of the world. The benefits are many - better
                control, coordination, focuses on developing core strength (developing muscles in
                and around the abdominal muscles and back) and introduces efficiency of the body
                as a whole.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/Swimming-.jpg"
                alt="Swimming" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;SWIMMING&lt;/b&gt;- Perfect for summers, swimming is another whole body exercise which
                is very effective for burning calories while having fun. While providing an aerobic
                workout, it works on stiff muscles and sore joints, increases muscle tone and strength
                and improves flexibility. Because swimming is an aerobic exercise, it serves to
                strengthen the heart making it more efficient in pumping - which leads to better
                blood flow throughout your body.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/kick-boxing.jpg"
                alt="Kick Boxing" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;KICK-BOXING&lt;/b&gt;- It is exactly what you are thinking - you have to kick and box
                your way to fitness. It is derived from martial arts and is based on kicking and
                punching and is derived from Karate and western boxing. Kickboxing workouts combine
                martial arts techniques with heart-pumping cardio, which means you can get a total
                body workout and whip yourself into shape in no time. It has also been known to
                reduce stress levels, improves coordination, tone muscles, boosts energy and leads
                to better posture. Also, it is a mega calorie burner with one hour of kickboxing
                having the potential of burning over 800 calories!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/health/Fun-to-burn-Calories/boxing-Born-.jpg"
                alt="Boxing" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source:www.themetapicture.com
            &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;BOXING&lt;/b&gt;- If you canâ€™t find kick boxing training nearby, just go boxing. It
                has its benefits and you get to punch something hard - relieve all your tension
                and pent up anger there! It tones your muscle structure and helps in developing
                self defence skills, acts like a workout for the entire body, toning your muscles
                and helping you lose weight. Also, because of all that punching, you will tend to
                have stronger and slimmer arms - good thing for going sleeveless this summer!
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Do remember that for each of the recommended activities here; sustenance is important.
                You canâ€™t do it once for five minutes and hope to lose weight. You should do them
                for some time for them to be effective for you. Pick up the one you like and enjoy.
                Try varying these, mixing up what you like and do them for a considerable amount
                of time to see results.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h6&gt;
                Losing weight is easy if you are having fun while at it.
