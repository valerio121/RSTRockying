    &lt;b&gt;About:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a target="_blank" title="Samantha Bangayan" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/samanthaluy"&gt;
        Samantha Bangayan&lt;/a&gt; is a Canadian expat currently living in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huancayo"&gt;
            Huancayo&lt;/a&gt;, Peru. She was born in the Philippines, grew up in Vancouver,
    and moved to Peru indefinitely in 2010.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Peru/Trimble_Peru_070910.JPG" title=""
            alt="" style="float: left;" height="232" width="309"&gt;Favorite holiday destination:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Sam lives in the Central Andes and claims to have fallen in love with Huancayo soon
    after her arrival in 2008.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Why she loves what she loves!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Huancayo is isolated in the Mantaro Valley, so even though it’s a growing city with
    a population of over 500,000, there’s still a strong feeling of culture and tradition.
    What is extremely attractive to her about Huancayo is the slower and more relaxed
    pace of life. The first and only mall there was constructed only 3 years ago in
    2009.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;What Huancayo is famous for?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Huancayo is famous for its surrounding rural towns where there are generations of
    artisans. There are specific towns famous for gourds, metalwork, and textiles. The
    city is also famous for its trekking tours as it’s surrounded by mountains.&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Peru/Acrobatics_Huancayo.jpg"
        title="Acrobatics at Huancayo " alt="" style="float: right; height: 250px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Sam's personal favorite spot in Huancayo is the old shooting range where they go
    to practice &lt;b&gt;acrobatics&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a large piece of land with cushiony grass to
    soften landings and a backdrop of grazing farm animals. One can easily walk there
    from downtown Huancayo yet when you get to the shooting range, it feels like you’re
    in your own world where you can truly relax and/or achieve anything.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Best time to visit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    It’s best to visit Huancayo from March to August. The rest of the year is thunderstorm
    season with unpredictable stormy weather, including thunder, lightning, and hail,
    at any time of the day. If you’re able to, try and make it over in late July when
    all of Peru partakes in a weeklong Independence Day celebration. In Huancayo, there
    is also the Andean tradition of Santiago in honor of the Saint Santiago during the
    month of August. Fiestas of Santiago in rural communities near Huancayo traditionally
    involve dancing with farm animals, but Santiago can also be celebrated in the city
    with dancing through the streets accompanied by a band hired for the day.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Costs - affordable / luxury?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Living and traveling in Huancayo is very affordable because it’s off the beaten
    path. Hostels near downtown can be as cheap as $4 per night and a typical meal at
    a family restaurant will cost less than $2. These meals always include soup, a main
    dish, a drink, and sometimes dessert too. Buses between Lima and Huancayo range
    from $8-25 for a one-way ticket.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Anything we missed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Since there aren’t many tourists that visit Huancayo, one will be forced to use
    and practice Spanish. Huancainos generally speak slowly and enunciate, so it won’t
    be too difficult to develop language skills there.&lt;br&gt;
