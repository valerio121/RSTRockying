    &lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Ekta%20Kapoor.jpg" title="Ekta Kapoor"
        alt="" style="float: left;"/&gt;She is popularly known as the queen of Television,
    but as she forayed into the world of Silver screen, gave ace filmmakers a run for
    their money. Ekta Kapoor is currently basking in the success of her latest flick
    the Dirty picture which got raving reviews from cinema lovers.&lt;br&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;However, the 36 year old finds it difficult to keep herself away from the
    small screen and at a launch of her latest serial ‘Kya hua Tera Vaada’ she had no
    qualms in giving her due to television and that no matter what she does she will
    always come back to her homeground, her daily soaps.&lt;br&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;Ekta’s works like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu thi and Kahaani ghar ghar ki,
    popularly known as the saas-bahu serials received huge acclaim and made her into
    the Queen of Prime time shows.&lt;br&gt;
    The Icon, coming from a star studded family of father Jitendra and brother Tusshar
    Kapoor could have easily got into acting but instead opted to make her own mark
    through the idiot box.
    &lt;br&gt;
    The Producer, also has hits like Shoot out at Lokhandwala and Once Upon a time in
    Mumbaai to her credit.&lt;br&gt;
    The stylish lass may have made it huge on both screens but still remains grounded
    and accredits her art of storytelling to her knowledge from the small screen. She
    says “Coming back to work on television from films is like coming back home from
    a long vacation”.&lt;br&gt;
    2011 turned out a mixed bag for Ekta. Brother Tusshar’s performance in Shor in the
    City gathered applause but not good enough for the film to work at the Box office.
    &lt;br&gt;
    Next came Ragini MMS guaranteeing to be the scariest movie ever but came and went
    without grabbing much attention.&lt;br&gt;
    Ekta’s lady luck had something else in store for her coz then had to come ... The
    Dirty picture. Excellent direction by Milan Luthria, and superb acting performance
    by Vidya Balan helped Ekta Kapoor proved her metal once again.&lt;br&gt;
    So now, let us all get set for her much awaited sequel of “Once Upon a Time in mumbaai”
    where Akshay the Khiladi Boy plays the lead. Way to go Lady. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
