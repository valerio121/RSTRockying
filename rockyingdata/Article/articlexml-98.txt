    that time of the year again! With summer just around the corner, chances are that
    you will already be looking for that perfect summer escape. However, a lot goes
    into making a holiday special for your loved ones- planning your leave, preparing
    the itinerary, selecting and booking the perfect retreat, making all the travel
    arrangements- the list seems endless and seems daunting at first. Not to worry though,
    we are here to tell you about a few things that you should keep in mind to plan
    and enjoy a hassle-free holiday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    FIRST THINGS FIRST&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Do a fair bit of research before packing your bags for an unknown destination to
    avoid nasty surprises later. If you are traveling to Ladakh then you
    will need at least two days to acclimatize to the climate. Many other exotic destinations,
    both at home and abroad require several official permission slips like in the North
    Eastern India. The weather is a crucial factor as well; monsoons in the Andamans
    can turn any trip into a nightmare. Online forums like &lt;a href="http://www.indiamike.com/"
        target="_blank"&gt;Indiamike.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank"&gt;
            Tripadvisor.com&lt;/a&gt; coupled with traditional &lt;a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://travel.outlookindia.com/" target="_blank"&gt;
                    Outlook Traveler&lt;/a&gt; guide books are a great source for this research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    BOOK YOUR HOLIDAY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The next thing, start booking for hotels &amp;amp; flight tickets. Timely plans can
    save you a great deal on the flight tickets whereas traveling off-season to tourist
    magnets like Goa and Kerala can be surprisingly cheap in the off-season. Going to
    the traditional operators like &lt;a href="http://www.sotc.com" target="_blank"&gt;SOTC&lt;/a&gt;
    can give you some very well planned packages while online options give you a lot
    more variety. While traveling abroad for the first time it is advisable to stick
    to a known operator like Kuoni unless one’s bohemian spirit is in overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    NAVIGATE ONLINE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Travel portals such as &lt;a href="http://www.makemytrip.com"&gt;MakeMytrip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cleartrip.com"&gt;
        Cleartrip&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.yatra.com"&gt;Yatra&lt;/a&gt;
    and &lt;a href="http://www.expedia.com"&gt;Expedia&lt;/a&gt; offer many great deals on flights
    and hotels saving you the effort of dealing with moody hotel sales reps. You can
    choose from an enormous variety of packages like group tours, honeymoon, and family
    trips, all-women trips, adventure packs, and health packages with an EMI option also
    thrown in at times for good measure. Be sure to always read the terms and conditions
    though, especially the inclusions and hidden charges/tax details before booking
    a holiday from a portal. Do not hesitate to call up the customer care center repeatedly
    with your doubts and you should soon be able to pick a holiday package that best
    suits your requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Look out for special deals in these travel portals. They launch different packages
    during winter, summer, and around the festive time such as Diwali, Christmas. For example,
    Kuoni India’s outbound travel brand SOTC Sports has announced the launch of its
    special promotion with Malaysia Tourism for sports enthusiasts in India to experience
    the Formula 1 Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    FINANCIAL BIT&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Be absolutely clear about financial rules when traveling abroad. According to the
    Reserve Bank of India, you can carry only $3000 in cash while traveling to most
    countries, be sure to double-check specifically about your selected destination.
    It is also advisable to always carry money in the combination of prepaid forex cards,
    credit/debit cards and travelers’ cheques. Also, carry cash in combinations of international
    currency like dollar along with the local &lt;a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/"
        target="_blank"&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Travel%20Planning/Plan%20your%20trip.jpg"
            title="Plan Your Trip" alt="" style="width: 400px;" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;currency
    of the place, you are visiting. Carrying an international calling card/ SIM and switching
    off data on international roaming can save you a packet too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    INSURING YOUR TRIP&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Even after planning every small detail of your trip, there are chances that you
    may face unexpected situations like cancellation of flights, delay in flight, loss
    of luggage, accidents, etc. In order to ensure a hassle-free holiday abroad, you should
    buy travel insurance. While you cannot travel to certain countries without travel
    insurance, it is a must even if you are traveling to countries that do not make
    it compulsory. These were those ‘must take care of’ travel planning tips from us.
    Hope it helps you go out, explore and discover more and more fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
