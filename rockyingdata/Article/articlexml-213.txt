         stay fit while eating out&lt;/a&gt; while eating your &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/30"&gt;
            favorite fatty foods&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/100" target="_blank"&gt;
                shopping&lt;/a&gt; and why we think everyone will just look and feel so much
    more awesome after the weight loss (&lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/8" target="_blank"&gt;yes
        why?&lt;/a&gt;). Not only will it make you healthier but much more confident about
    yourself and your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So, &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com"&gt;Rockying&lt;/a&gt; brings to you a little bit about
    some celebrities who lost weight and also how they did it. Here’s hoping this will
    get you up and running!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    SONAKSHI SINHA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Sonakshi.jpg"
    alt="Sonakshi Sinha Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The original Dabangg girl knew she had to put in the extra effort before she could
    make her way to the top. Though Dabangg saw Sonakshi in a healthier avatar, her
    body seems to be getting better, every time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Sonakshi’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No carbohydrates after 6pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Loads of Green Tea&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Regular exercise. (Have you not heard this a million times?)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hot Yoga&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No short cuts to the door of glory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    KATRINA KAIF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/katrina-B4-After.jpg"
    alt="Katrina Kaif Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Yes, hang your jaw in amazement, but Katrina wasn’t always the super trim Sheila
    we see her as now. Though she wasn’t highly overweight, the Barbied Katrina managed
    shedding off the extra pounds for a super trim and fit look. And the results are
    for all to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;datasource name="boxaddatasource" /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Katrina’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Plenty of water and fruits&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Eat the right food at the right time.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Positive addiction to physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Avoiding starch completely (Though we do not advice that, because starch helps the
        body produce energy and boycotting it may prove bad for health in the long run).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    ADNAN SAMI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Adnan-Sami.jpg"
    alt="Adnan Sami Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Having lost over 130 kilos Sami is probably the “biggest” weight loss story of the
    Bollywood fraternity. Earlier he required seat belt extension on planes, couldn’t
    lie down for sleeping and needed rest after climbing five steps. In about a year,
    Adnan Sami went from all this to enjoying tennis and squash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Adnan’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Seek expert advice. His diet regime might just not work the same for you. As he
        says, “Some people just gain weight by smelling food”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In his case (which is an exception), sheer determination, apart from initial dieting
        and gradual exercising, was the key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    ZARINE KHAN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Zarine-B4-After.jpg"
    alt="Zarine Khan Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The flabby Katrina look alike was once tagged as Fatrina! She weighed a whopping
    100 kgs before getting into films, but the determined girl decided to stop the wagging
    tongues by going on a strict diet and is now a healthy 57 kgs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    She flaunted her super toned body in Houseful 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Zarine’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An hour of &lt;a href="http://pilates.about.com/od/whatispilates/a/WhatIsPilates.htm"&gt;
        Pilates&lt;/a&gt; every morning.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Weight training, swimming and jogging to increase her metabolic rate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A complete no-no to sweet and fried food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    SONAM KAPOOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/SonamB4-After.jpg"
    alt="Sonam Kapoor Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    India’s most fashionable lady was once quite heavy. But when she decided to get
    into movies, she decided to shed off the extra weight too. Acknowledging her mother’s
    determination to keep her off chocolates, ice creams, fried food she mentions how
    a combination of yoga, Pilates and Kathak helped her put off weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Sonam’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;High protein, six-small-meals-a-day-diet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An early dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cardio-vascular exercises. (weight-training isn’t just for men to bulk-up)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No to caffeine, yes to Green tea.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Classical Dancing (Kathak) and playing Squash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    KAREENA KAPOOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/kareena-lost-and-gained.jpg"
    alt="Kareena Kapoor Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    From a flabby teenager to a much more glamorous almost size zero! Though we don’t
    approve the size zero look, we love Kareena for how she has managed to shed down
    and then gain the kilos to look amazing. She consulted and worked under Dieticians
    and nutritionists and switched to healthy versions of eating food. Also, she involved
    in power yoga and managed to do about a 100 Surya Namaskars at one go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Kareena’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Exercising right (Power Yoga upto 40 minutes and 50 &lt;a href="http://health.india.com/fitness/surya-namaskar-more-than-just-a-bollywood-fad/"
        target="_blank"&gt;Surya Namaskars&lt;/a&gt; twice a day)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The good-old dal, rice and sabzi for an equi-carb-protein-diet. She says, “the no-carb
        (carbohydrates) diet is silly”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    SAMEERA REDDY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Sameera.jpg"
    alt="Sameera Reddy Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    She went from a whopping 105 kilos to super sexy and fit avatar she is in now. Sameera
    says it was very tough for her, given her healthy physique and the love for food.
    But she decided to combine good food with the right amount of exercise and reach
    where she is right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Sameera’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‘Lauki-juice’ (gourd juice) she says is a miracle worker.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Eat to survive. Don’t gorge.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 years of intensive weight-loss regime. Which goes to say, folks it ain’t happening
        overnight! You gotta work and wait for it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    KARAN JOHAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/karan-johar.jpg"
    alt="Karan Johar Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The director every star dreams to work with was once battling weight issues himself.
    He says determination to look healthy (not skinny!) will make it happen. Resorting
    to the age old mantra - combination of exercise and healthy food options - is what
    helped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Karan’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Know your body. Learn to accept it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Drink more water than you think is physically possible.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Learn to love your greens”.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;“Surround yourself with people that are content in their skin.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    RANI MUKHERJI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/rani-B4-After.jpg"
    alt="Rani Mukherji Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Rani received a lot of flak for her weight. But when she donned a bikini for Dil
    Bole Hadippa, she did it with ease. A lot of people were stunned by her toned abs.
    Her secret is the age old good diet and exercise and she is a big fan of yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Rani’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Two hours Power-Yoga every morning.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Walking up and down the stairs of her bungalow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    ARJUN KAPOOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/arjun-kapoor.jpg"
    alt="Arjun Kapoor Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another from the Kapoor family, Boney Kapoor’s son and the latest heartthrob from
    Ishaqzaade, Arjun weighed about a 140 kilos a few years back. He says, “Determination
    goes a long way in weight loss because there really isn’t any quick fix”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Arjun’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combining healthy food with cardio and weights.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bajra roti in place of atta roti.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Crossfit regime to knock off the extra calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    MARIAH CAREY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Mariah-Carey.jpg"
    alt="Mariah Carey Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Known for her powerful vocals, her songwriting and her acting skills; Mariah gained
    70 pounds during her pregnancy. She decided to shed it off and managed to return
    to the super glam personality she was always known for. Yes, we love the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Mariah’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Jenny Craig’s diet plan that restricted her intake to 1500 calories per day.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Gymming thrice a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    JASON SEGAL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Jason-Segal.jpg"
    alt="Jason Segal Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The adorable Marshall of How I Met Your Mother reached his high of 113 kgs and was
    forced to lose weight for his film The Five-Year Engagement, also co-written by
    him, released in April this year. Sticking to the mantra of healthy eating and exercise
    he managed to lose over 13 kgs and still is continuing to achieve better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Jason’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Work-outs at work under expert supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    JENNIFER HUDSON&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Jennifer-Hudson.jpg"
    alt="Jennifer Hudson Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    She has many accolades to her name - an American Idol contestant, Academy Award
    winner, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe winner. But Hudson was also known for her heavy
    built. It’s ironical that her “Oscar-role” (for Dream Girls) came when she was all filled-up. Great timing though, she managed to shed off the extra pounds and look fab!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Jennifer’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Weight Watchers program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    ALEC BALDWIN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/alec-baldwin-before-after.jpg"
    alt="Alec Baldwin Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Film, television and stage actor and Academy Award winner Alec Baldwin gets our
    vote for being fit 53! Having being diagnosed as pre-diabetic, Baldwin managed to
    lose over 13 kgs in four months. He owes the success to a no sugar diet, pilates
    and spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Alec’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A no-sugar-no-starch diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    KELLY OSBURNE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/kelly-osbourne.jpg"
    alt="Kelly Osbourne Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Her participation in Dancing with the stars made her lose weight. But she says,
    maintaining a regular dancing schedule, pilates and balanced meals helped her maintain
    the healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Kelly’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Following the &lt;a href="http://www.barmethod.com/exercises/core-strengthening-exercises.html"&gt;
        Bar Method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Water instead of soda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    DREW BARRYMORE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Drew-b4-after.jpg"
    alt="Drew Barrymore Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Known for her acting in movies like 50 First Dates, Posion Ivy and E.T; actor, director,
    screenwriter, producer and model Drew Barrymore has always been in the limelight.
    She managed to overcome all her addiction in life - her drug problems, her alcohol
    issues and also her weight issues. Drew is a fighter and her healthy weight just
    is an affirmation to that very fact. Portion controlled meals, yoga and running
    are her secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Drew’s Secret Mantra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type: square"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Five-mile runs, thrice a week.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Boot-camp-style-workout by Kathy Kaehler.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Power yoga instructed by Mark Blanchard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
    RICKY GERVAIS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/health/celebrity-Weight-Loss/Ricky-Gervais.jpg"
    alt="Ricky Gervais Fat Photo" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It is amazing how English comedian and former radio presenter Ricky looks after
    his weight loss. He managed to lose 20 pounds by getting active - yes, just by moving
    around a lot more than he used to. Littlish but every day!&lt;/p&gt;
