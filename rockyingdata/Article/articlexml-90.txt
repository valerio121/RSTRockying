    &lt;br&gt;
    Having lived in Abu Dhabi for over twenty years now, I couldn’t be anymore in love
    with the city. So what makes it interesting even after so, so many years! Many things!
    So let me dissect Abu Dhabi today and let me convince to book your tickets right
    away!&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;WHERE IS THIS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Close to its famous “cousin” Dubai; Abu Dhabi is the capital of United Arab Emirates.
    Though the city is located mostly on an island; it has been connected to the mainland
    through a network of bridges and continues to expand.
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;WHY YOU SHOULD BE HERE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Abu Dhabi is famous for too many things. Being one of the largest oil manufacturers
    in the world; the city is now also known for its huge developments in the tourism
    sector which makes it one of the favorite with holiday goers.&amp;nbsp; Here are some
    of the famous attractions of the lovely city:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Abu%20Dhabi/Sheikh_Zayed_Mosque_Night.jpg"
        title="Sheikh Zayed Mosque" alt="" style="float: left; height: 250px;"&gt;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque&lt;/b&gt; - Named after the founder of UAE, HH Sheikh
    Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the majestic Mosque is probably a work of art in itself.
    The mosque has a capacity of about 40,000 worshipers and is looked upon as one of
    the most magnificent architectural wonders in the world. Coveted as the largest
    mosque in the country, the Grand Mosque will leave you stunned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Abu%20Dhabi/YasMarinaisland.jpg"
        title="Yas Marina Island" alt="" style="float: right; height: 250px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    •&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Yas Marina Island&lt;/b&gt; - An artificial island holding the
    Yas Island Circuit, the host for the Formula One Grand Prix since 2009, the Yas
    Island has become one of the hottest tourist spots. It also contains the &lt;a href="http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/"&gt;
        Ferrari World&lt;/a&gt;- the world’s largest indoor theme park that tells the story
    of Ferrari in all its glory. Also it features amusement rides and games. The World’s
    Fastest Roller Coaster - &lt;a href="http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/attractions/formula-rossa.aspx"&gt;
        Formula Rossa&lt;/a&gt; is also there at the Ferrari world with a speed of 240 km/hr,
    you can get a feel of what 4.8 Gs is like! Speed buffs, pack your bags!&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    •&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Abu%20Dhabi/emirates_palace_Hotel.jpg"
        title="The Emirates Palace Hotel" alt="" style="float: left; height: 250px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;b&gt;The Emirates Palace Hotel&lt;/b&gt; - one of the most magnificent luxury hotels in
    the country. Though a little hard on the pocket (this hotel actually offers the
    one million dollar tailor made suite holiday - the most expensive holiday) the hotel
    could be visited for tourism reason purely.
    &lt;br&gt;
    •&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Gardens and Parks &lt;/b&gt;- For those of you in love with the
    outside and want to enjoy a peaceful lazy vacation , Abu Dhabi has over 2000 well
    maintained gardens and parks.
    &lt;br&gt;
    •&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The city offers a host of services - desert safaris for exploring
    the deserts and having a feel of what it is like, helicopter tours for a birds eye
    view of the city and bus tours running throughout the day. Boat rides on the Marina
    are a perfect way to end the day.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;BEST TIME TO VISIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Abu Dhabi is a hot place; experiencing extremely high temperatures during the summers
    coupled with high humidity, the best time to visit has to be between November and
    March. Though the country does experience fogs during this time of the year, most
    of the days are pleasant otherwise.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;HARD ON THE POCKET?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Abu Dhabi has been regarded as the 67th most expensive city in the world. However,
    keeping in mind that public transport and air tickets are affordable, the place
    is worth every penny spent. Also, most of the parks and beaches have free access,
    the bus rides around the city are cheaply priced and overall offer a wonderful experience.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    There really are no reasons as not to visiting the city. With its amazing architecture,
    the variety of cuisines available, the beaches, parks and the luxury sightseeing,
    Abu Dhabi makes for the perfect holiday spot.&lt;br&gt;
