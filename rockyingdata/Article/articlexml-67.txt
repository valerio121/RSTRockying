Caring selflessly and providing home for dogs, it began with a small land space of 17 sq ft sans any electricity or water. Today they have proudly expanded into a space that is triple its size and with the same motive: giving home to the homeless and trying to find them new homes.

Statistics show that the rate of abandonment increases as the dogs grow old. Friendicoes have dealt with cases where the pets were abandoned as a part of some astrological advice. This is where a non-profit organization saw a scope that involved a more humane angle towards the voiceless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diaries&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target="" title="Snap Deal" href="http://www.rockying.com/a/64"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/65"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/66"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rockying.com/a/68"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
