Very few places in the world are just as beautiful as Leh in Ladakh, Himalaya. Surrounded by mud-brick houses and stupas, Leh is a wonder town where the places of interest are still all-natural and untouched by urbanism. The magnificent beauty of this place is highlighted by the imposing Tibetan styled fort and palace in the Old Town. Right next to the fort, there’s a crowded bazaar filled with tandoori-pizza bistros and souvenir shops; all around the place the vibe is outstanding. The narrow footpaths lead to traditional styled homes and lodging places with ornate window frames made of wood and sturdy walls. It’s genuinely easy to fall in love with Leh.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.rockying.com/art/Travel/Himalaya%20Travel%20%E2%80%93%20Surrendering%20to%20Leh%E2%80%99s%20magnificent%20beauty/Leh-Shanti-Stupa-Ladakh.jpg"&gt;
