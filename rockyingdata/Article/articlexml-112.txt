    &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;he reason why we call it weird is because not every individual outside India
    is subjected to such tastes. Rockying lists the top five weird things that people
    have in the country. However, we do keep in mind the conflicts behind the term “weird”
    because what is considered weird out here might be a cuisine for others! Read on
    to find if any of these suit your taste or disagree with us accordingly!&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOMUTRA&lt;/b&gt; (Cow’s Urine): Known for its brilliant medicinal properties, this
        is rural India’s favorite medicated drink. Ayurveda recommends it as an antidote
        for thyroid, common cold, cough, cholesterol, constipation and even acne! Indians
        have been using this as a suitable remedy for 1000s of years. But isn’t getting
        treated with animal excreta a little unusual?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Weird%20tastes%20of%20INdia/gomutra2%281%29.jpg"
            title="A cow releasing urine" alt="" style="height: 400px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;PHANTOM CIGARETTES&lt;/b&gt;: This one is actually on the weirder side. Remember the
        candy sticks with a red tip? Sweet cigarettes have been every child’s must possession.
        On the contrary, children get to feel what it is like to hold a cigarette in hand
        even though we know it is just a peppermint made into a cigarette-like thing. If
        the whole idea is to make children avoid smoking, then why allow them to smoke a
        fake one in the first place? Most children who smoked phantom cigarettes as kids
        took up full-time smoking as adults. Weird, but true!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Weird%20tastes%20of%20INdia/phantom%20cigs.jpg"
            title="Phantom Cigarettes" alt="" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;PICKLED MACKEREL FISH "RAW"&lt;/b&gt;: Trust us with this. Dried and pickled mackerel
        fish tastes like sour lime and the smell is as nauseating as ammonia. There is absolutely
        nothing appetizing about this cuisine, is it?&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;
            &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Food/Weird%20tastes%20of%20INdia/Pickeled_Mackerel_Fish.jpg"
                title="Raw Pickeled Mackerel Fish" alt="" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BHANG THANDAI&lt;/b&gt;: Bhang leaves or marijuana generously grated in milk shakes
        and sugar along with crushed almonds and pistachio. Sounds very scrumptious and
        almost every individual in the country have had this or desire to have this once
        in their lives during Holi. What kick does one get? Well, it can send your body
        fluids, intestines and brain for a funny ride. While you do random things for fun,
        the next morning you might not remember what you did to have fun yesterday. We sure
        do have ways of having fun the weird way!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;YAK BUTTER TEA&lt;/b&gt;: A Tibetan drink, this is just simply not the way a conventional
        cup of tea is had. Yak butter tea is made from tea leaves, yak butter and salt instead
        of milk! We wonder why it is called a tea anyway!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
