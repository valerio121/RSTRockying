    Binsar has been a true case of a road less traveled for not many people know about
    it. A breathtaking journey that amazes you with different shades of greenery, the
    merging peaks of Nanda Devi, Kedarnath and the Shivling Trishul all come together
    for that perfect view at &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/210"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;(Take
    on our photographic journey to explore Binsar better, through the eyes!).&lt;a href="//www.rockying.com/a/210"&gt;

            alt="Binsar" class="pull-right" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    Where To Stay?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Binsar is still an unexplored place by tourists. Choose a resort (trust us, these
    resorts are not at all expensive considering the commercial tourist places that
    India offers), especially in the months of April, May and June, wake up to a golden
    sunrise and take a short walk on the hilly slopes. Rockying suggests &lt;a href="http://www.clubmahindra.com/AboutResortInfo/binsar_valley_resort"
        target="_blank"&gt;Club Mahindra Valley Resort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kasaarjungleresort.com/"
            target="_blank"&gt;Kasaar Jungle Resort&lt;/a&gt; as the best spa resorts in the
    the city which is located right in the middle of mountains and offer the best intellectual
    spas you can think of! The next best alternative is booking a luxurious estate for
    your stay. These are almost like the service apartments of Singapore but with an
    excellent room service. However, budget hotels like Binsar Eco Camp will not take
    away from the peace and serenity that this place has to offer. If you want to stay
    closer to nature still, look out for some well-maintained log huts built in the
    outskirts of the forest camping areas. Those are high on cozy-factor and easy on
    your budget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
    Now, let us get some of the traveling FUNDAS clear:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Small and remote hill stations like Binsar are NOT commercial in nature. So do not
                expect shopping malls or multiplexes in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Local vendors and shopkeepers do sell local wears and brightly knitted gloves and
                woolens that any tourist would find it to be a value-for-money purchase. You can
                lookout for those!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Carry a good camera with you. You might just go mad clicking all your way in the
                city and a good lens does make a hell lot of difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    The MUST Try:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The new-definition bread pakoras in Siddhi Restaurant near the Kainchi Dam can become
            your staple diet out there. They are so gorgeous, piping hot, and simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Club Mahindra has a wide range of interesting activities such as candle making,
            reading rooms, clay modeling etc. Rockying calls this the finest way of unwinding
            from daily traffic and chores. Letâ€™s get our hands soiled in some clay, what say?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Trek, trek and trek. You can approach your hotel reception for booking professional
            trekkers who can guide you through rough terrains and scaly mountains for that ultimate
            escapade into the nature. Do it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Visit the wildlife sanctuary. Animal lovers will love it all the more and people
            otherwise will find the walk around the sanctuary liberating. You would find some
            220 species of birds out there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Standing at Zero Point and watching the sun slowly stir in its orange hues in the
            the sky is an experience that makes India different from the city grind. The snow-capped
            peaks against the orange sunrise is a guaranteed poetic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The Golu Devta Temple is a small but well-known local deity which is situated
            just 4 km away from Binsar. Coordinate the trip with your resort officials and
            do visit this temple. If you are not really a religious fanatic, then the architecture
            might just take your breath away!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Try to figure some time out for a trip to the Japanese Cave that holds the history
            of the place. This cave was a hideout for the Japanese army. The cave took as many
            as 3000 lives of Japanese soldiers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;
