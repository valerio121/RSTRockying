    &lt;a href="http://very.late-bloomers.net/"&gt;Barbara Klein&lt;/a&gt;, lives and works in Basel,
    Switzerland and loves to share her life of food and recipes, travels, writing and
    photography. The following is an interview in her own words as told to &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/139"&gt;
        Rockying&lt;/a&gt;. Lets dive into her introspective voyage to India:&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    I have always been fascinated with India, its people and history and when my friend
    and I decided on a four weeks &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda"&gt;Ayurvedan
        therapy&lt;/a&gt; it was clear from the start: only India would be the perfect place
    for our venture. After long planning we found the ideal resort in &lt;a href="http://www.keralatourism.org/"&gt;
        Kerala&lt;/a&gt; and were very happy to have chosen &lt;a href="http://somatheeram.in/"&gt;Somatheeram&lt;/a&gt;
    for its tradition and spectacular settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The resort is close to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivandrum"&gt;Trivandrum
        (now thiruvananthapuram)&lt;/a&gt;, an hour’s drive to the south. Overwhelming first
    impressions of the vivid colors of blossoming trees and shrubs, traffic noise, flavors,
    especially after a practically sleepless night on the plane.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Coming into the resort is like the entrance to paradise&lt;/b&gt;: all noise of modern
    civilization is blotted out and we hear the sound of breaking waves, birds and smell
    the wonderful scents of thousands of flowers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
    My home for the next three weeks was &lt;b&gt;a lovely cottage&lt;/b&gt; directly above the
    beach, 120 steps away from the main buildings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;br&gt;
    After the first of my daily consultations with the doctors on the premises I am
    told my&lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosha"&gt;dosha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (fundamental
    bodily humors that constitute the body) type: &lt;b&gt;Pitta&lt;/b&gt;, the most common of the
    three types, this is very important for the therapy we will follow the next three
    weeks: apart from the daily treatments of massages we will adhere to a strict diet,
    abstain from drinking alcohol, fizzy beverages, coffee and only eat vegetarian dishes.
    I have also decided to refrain from smoking. It is advised to stay out of the sun
    and swimming in the pool or in the sea is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/139"&gt;

    &lt;br&gt;
    I am advised to take some Ayurvedic medication (including ghee) to help the detox.
    Not too pleasant but who says medicine should be sweet?&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;The first days were difficult&lt;/b&gt;: constant headaches, hardly any sleep, feeling
    hot and sweating a lot. My body certainly tells me how much I have abused it before.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;SUNRISE AT 6 AM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Slowly we get used to our new daily rhythm, we start the day before sunset with
    a leisurely walk along the beach watching the sunrise, followed by a cup of curipathi
    (probably this is cheating, but we do not really want to know what’s in it) in front
    of my lovely cottage.
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Breakfast and then treatments, general massage with hot oil, rejuvenation massage,
    and all the other treatments according to our treatment sheet such as: Nasyam, Dhanyamly
    Dhara, Virechana, Pizhichil Sarvangadhara etc., lunch, the daily doctor’s visit,
    some more treatments, Yoga, Chakra meditation, dinner. Early to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Ayurvedan Therapy at Somatheeram (That's not me in the picture though)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I enjoy our Ayurvedan food, you help yourself from a huge buffet. And between us:
    this helps me to cheat with my Pitta diet as I 'steal' snippets from Vata and Kapha
    dishes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We love to eat dinner outside, sometimes there is a very welcome slight breeze of
    fresh air.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    We have little free time between treatments and meals but we sometimes venture outside
    and go to the local shops. I am a very popular customer (I have this gap between
    my front teeth!) and a hard bargainer but I end up with far too many things from
    tailor-made clothes, jewellery, saffron and other spices, spoons made of buffalo
    horn to tons of textile materials from &lt;a href="http://www.parthastvm.com/"&gt;Parthas&lt;/a&gt;,
    a colorful dreamland for shopaholics in Trivandrum. I buy a Churidar (stretchy fitted
    trousers) that is not only beautiful and comfortable but ideal to be worn in this
    heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The days weave into weeks, one highlight is our trip down South to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanyakumari"&gt;
        Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, visiting temples on the way and taking a boat
    out to the rock memorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="//rockying.com/art/Travel/Kerala-India/vivekananda-rock-.jpg"
        title="Vivekananda Rock Memorial KanyaKumari" alt="" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    It is time to leave and fly back to Switzerland, heavy suitcases (we have more than
    20 kilos overweight) filled with our Indian treasures and lots of lovely memories
    in our hearts.&lt;b&gt; I will be back!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So that was Barbara, with her revelation of experiences, good and bad. Kerala is
    unwinding indeed. We suggest you undertake our &lt;a href="//rockying.com/a/139"&gt;
        exclusive photographic journey &lt;/a&gt;to the place and accomplish mission Kerala!&lt;br&gt;
